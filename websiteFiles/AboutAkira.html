            <h1>About Akira</h1>
            <p> The 1988 theatrical release of the popular anime Akira was groundbreaking for Western audiences as an introduction to Katsuhiro Otomo's manga adaptation originally published in Japan's Young Magazine. While approximately half of the original story was cut for time purposes, the movie stunned audiences with what is considered the pinnacle of cell animation: A cel, short for celluloid, is a transparent sheet on which objects are drawn or painted for traditional, hand-drawn animation. The explosive impact of its highly detailed animation and its intensely violent saga of power and corruption has been studied by fans, students, and cinema professionals for decades.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>The setting of Akira the dystopic Neo-Tokyo 30 years after World War III was started by the climactic, and atomically explosive metamorphosis of the child Akira, a Frankenstein experiment gone horribly wrong. What emerges from the rubble are riotous citizens fed up with an Orwellian government still reveling in their "achievement" of surviving another World War, densely packed streets and high-tech skyscrapers, and degenerate youth who sometimes resort to drugs and motorcycles to escape the harsh realities of growing up.  The government continues its experiments on young children who inherit psychic powers only controlled by constant monitoring, isolation, and medication. They come to be known as the Espers, as they remain child-like despite physically aging to the point of appearing elderly. After one of these children collides with a biker, Tetsuo, and his fellow gang members, "The Capsules" ("good for health bad for education" is their motto), the government takes Tetsuo to a hospital ward and notices that his mind is psychically active (like everyone else's). The decision is made to take on a new experiment with Tetsuo, which is dangerous considering his age and, unbeknownst to the scientists, his life-long inferiority complex.</p>
            <p>What results is Otomo's vision of how certain individuals react to obtaining super powers, which begs the introspective question to every viewer: "If you had super powers like these, would you be able to suppress the emotions of revenge?"</p>
            
            <h2>Soundtrack</h2>
