            <h1>Akira: Fluctuations of Power and Control</h1>
            <p> The 1988 theatrical release of the popular anime Akira was groundbreaking for Western audiences as an introduction to Katsuhiro Otomo's manga adaptation originally published in Japan's Young Magazine.  While approximately half of the original story was cut out for time purposes, the movie stunned audiences with what is considered the pinnacle of cel animation.  The explosive impact of its highly detailed animation and its intensely violent saga of power and corruption has been studied by fans, students, and cinema professionals for decades.</p>
            <p> This site analyzes the theme of control.  Many characters possess, desire, gain, abuse, and lose it throughout the film.  The setting is the dystopic Neo-Tokyo 30 years after World War III was started by the climactic, and atomically explosive metamorphasis of the child Akira: a Frankenstein experiment gone horribly wrong.  What emerges from the rubble are riotous citizens fed up with an Orewellian government still reveling in their "achievment" of surviving another world war, densly packed streets and high-tech skyscrapers, and degenerate youth who sometimes resort to drugs and motorcycles to escape the harsh reality of growing up.</p>
            <p>The government continues its experiments on young children who inherit psychic powers only controlled by constant monitoring, isolation, and medication.  They come to be known as the Espers, as they remain child-like, but physically age to the point of looking elderly.  After one of these children collides with a biker, Tetsuo, and his fellow gang members, "The Capsules" ("good for health bad for education" is their motto), the government takes him in and notices that his mind is psychically active (like everyone's).  The decision is made to take on a new experiment with Tetsuo, which is dangerous considering his age and, unbeknowest to the scientists, his life-long inferiority complex.</p>
