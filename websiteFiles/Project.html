                A special thanks goes to <strong>Dr. Elisa Beshero-Bondar</strong> for helping us with some issues that caused setbacks for us and guiding us through the creation process. <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero">Link to her GitHub</a>

            <h1>Methods</h1>
              <p>
                  Before we got started with gathering information on the control scenes, we decided to gather a list of all of the characters that appeared in the movie. We had aslo listed the characters in the order of which they first appeared. When we added the script to the code as well, we also made sure to include time stamps of when the characters speak.
                  </p>
            <div class="container">
                <div class="logo-box">
                    <img class = "Phooey" src="images/AkiraCharacterListSnip.PNG"/>
                    </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                After that, we got around to adding the code for the different scenes involving characters that are attempting to assert control over other characters. 
                </p>
                    <div class="container">
                        <div class="logo-box">
                            <img class = "Phooey" src="images/AkiraControlSceneSnip.PNG"/>
                        </div>
                    </div>
            <p>
                We also went and added the different scenes involving people using their powers against other characters as well. This can refer to someone using psychic powers, or someone shooting their gun at other characters.
                </p>
                            <div class="container">
                                <div class="logo-box">
                                    <img class = "Phooey" src="images/AkiraPowerSceneSnip.PNG"/>   
                                </div>
                            </div>
            <p>
                Then came the time to begin coding the schema for the website, which we created by making five separate coding documents to be linked, and creating a document specifically made for creating the appearance of the website.
            </p>
                <p>
                       We had also created an ODD file to help detail which characters appear in control scenes, along with splitting them up into categories of who uses superpowers and who doesn't. 
                </p>
                                    <div class="container">
                                        <div class="logo-box">
                                            <img class = "Phooey" src="images/AkiraControlODDSchemaSnip.PNG"/>
                                        </div>
                                    </div>
                       <p>
                           We also added code detailing the establishment of power scenes in the movie as well. These scenes were meant to show which characters were using powers against each other, with only a small list of people using their powers in the moivie.               
                </p>
                                            <div class="container">
                                                <div class="logo-box">
                                                    <img class = "Phooey" src="images/AkiraPowerODDSchemaSnip.PNG"/>
                                                </div>
                                            </div>
                <p>
                    The reason we decided to choose this for our project was because we all like the movie Akira, and we felt it important to do a project based on it to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the movie's release.
