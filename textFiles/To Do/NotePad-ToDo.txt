To Do
1:  Write up the project page with a description of what we did.  Include 5 pictures of the XML markup.  
    Be sure to capture an important control scene, the character list, and a “milestone” element that has a “powers” attribute with a descriptive note element saying what’s happening in the scene.  You’ll see it all in the XML file.  
   The last 2 pictures to get are some examples of the ODD which acted as the schema for the mark up.  Lines 50-85 somewhere in there.  Lines 112-145 ball park.  These are the TEI (THE primier standard for XML markup on the internet) elements and attributes that we used that are similar to the “drama” type markup (ie a play).  
1:  The first is the milestone element used to mark powers being used with a required note describing the scene.
2:  The second is the control scene mark up where we made a list of who appears in control scenes to dominate the scene and other characters, and sometimes VIE for control. Where they vie for control, we set a plural attribute value separated by white spaces.
One extra photo to add is the work in Exide to make
