1
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:02,929
Groups of unemployed workers,
who have grown in number...

2
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:07,683
due to tax reforms enacted by the former
Prime Minister, are rioting all across the country.

3
00:02:07,809 --> 00:02:10,061
There is confusion among parliament members
which was sparked by the comments...

4
00:02:10,187 --> 00:02:13,564
of Finance Minister Takanashi
during the recent parliament inquiry.

5
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,609
There seems to be no compromise in sight
between the government and opposition.

6
00:02:16,735 --> 00:02:18,861
- Hey, there. Call it.

7
00:02:18,862 --> 00:02:21,280
- Hey, there. Call it.
- Gimme somethin'. Three peanuts.

8
00:02:22,407 --> 00:02:24,033
Let's see......

9
00:02:25,369 --> 00:02:26,452
Now, uh......

10
00:02:38,924 --> 00:02:41,467
The Clown bastards are herded
out on route number 5.

11
00:02:44,429 --> 00:02:47,139
Damn it, don't scare me like that.
Open that damn door quietly.

12
00:02:47,265 --> 00:02:50,393
You know, you wouldn't be so jumpy
if you didn't have anything to hide.

13
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:54,647
Why don't you sell
normal drinks for a change?

14
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,734
How about buyin' somethin' for once?
This ain't a hangout for damn street gangs.

15
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,653
Yeah, right!
Drink your dog piss?

16
00:03:05,075 --> 00:03:07,994
Twin ceramic rotor drives
on each wheel.

17
00:03:08,078 --> 00:03:10,287
Let's see. And these are...

18
00:03:10,372 --> 00:03:14,625
computer-controlled
antilock brakes.

19
00:03:14,751 --> 00:03:17,336
Huh, 200 horses at 12,000 R.P.M.

20
00:03:20,298 --> 00:03:22,675
You want to ride it, Tetsuo?

21
00:03:22,801 --> 00:03:24,010
All right! Let's hit it!

22
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,266
I customized that bike for myself.
It's too wild. You couldn't handle it.

23
00:03:31,476 --> 00:03:34,520
I don't see how you could ride
something crazy like that, man.

24
00:03:36,314 --> 00:03:37,273
Huh! I could.

25
00:03:37,482 --> 00:03:40,526
Ha! If you want it so bad
then steal one yourself.

26
00:04:47,135 --> 00:04:48,052
- Unbelievable.

27
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:49,053
- Unbelievable.
- Punks!

28
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,432
Hey, waiter!
Where are you going?

29
00:04:57,062 --> 00:04:59,939
They ran into the alley!
After 'em!

30
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:15,955
Quit foolin' around, you idiot!

31
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:20,417
Fuck!

32
00:05:53,368 --> 00:05:54,410
What?

33
00:06:24,482 --> 00:06:25,649
- That's the......

34
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,275
- That's the......
- Huh?

35
00:06:26,401 --> 00:06:28,194
This is unit 375.

36
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,365
We've got reports of biker gangs fighting
near the intersection of highway 14 South.

37
00:06:33,491 --> 00:06:36,285
Request immediate assistance.
Car 375 en route to the scene......

38
00:06:37,996 --> 00:06:39,455
It's the cops.
What should we do?

39
00:06:39,748 --> 00:06:42,499
Damn it. My motor coils were
just getting warmed up.

40
00:06:48,673 --> 00:06:51,884
Bastards!
Let's go, Tetsuo!

41
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,302
I'm coming!

42
00:06:53,428 --> 00:06:54,303
- Damn them!

43
00:06:54,304 --> 00:06:55,221
- Damn them!
- Come on!

44
00:07:04,272 --> 00:07:07,650
A skirmish has broken out between student
protesters and riot police.

45
00:07:07,776 --> 00:07:10,736
There appear to be some
casualties. Next...

46
00:07:32,217 --> 00:07:34,343
Don't make me get out of this car!

47
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:36,553
Jerk, I'm in a hurry!

48
00:07:51,695 --> 00:07:53,737
- What was that?

49
00:07:53,738 --> 00:07:55,114
- What was that?
- Police is here!!

50
00:08:21,224 --> 00:08:24,727
This area is off limits!

51
00:08:24,978 --> 00:08:27,313
Go back! It's dangerous!

52
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:28,647
Hey, something strange
over there.

53
00:08:28,773 --> 00:08:30,316
Let me through!
Sorry.

54
00:08:30,442 --> 00:08:31,150
What're you doing?

55
00:08:39,617 --> 00:08:41,744
It's blood. Look!

56
00:08:42,203 --> 00:08:45,456
Please let me through.
Excuse me. Pardon me.

57
00:08:45,582 --> 00:08:47,249
Watch it, jerk!

58
00:08:50,962 --> 00:08:53,005
Pardon me. I'm sorry.

59
00:08:53,548 --> 00:08:54,340
Ryu!

60
00:08:54,716 --> 00:08:57,384
Hey, look!
They're running away!

61
00:09:02,223 --> 00:09:03,849
He's got a gun!

62
00:09:09,814 --> 00:09:11,690
Fire!

63
00:09:13,318 --> 00:09:15,194
Wait! He's got a kid!

64
00:09:25,789 --> 00:09:26,705
Run.

65
00:09:27,957 --> 00:09:29,833
You gotta hurry.

66
00:09:33,671 --> 00:09:36,048
Go to Ryu.

67
00:09:36,174 --> 00:09:39,051
Ryu will help you now.

68
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:45,057
Get out of here... Now!

69
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:19,508
Kei!

70
00:10:21,219 --> 00:10:23,762
We've gotta get out of here, Kei?

71
00:10:27,058 --> 00:10:28,767
He's gone!

72
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:39,194
He's to the West.

73
00:10:40,572 --> 00:10:43,198
West?
The old city......

74
00:10:54,586 --> 00:10:55,627
Eat this!

75
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:09,933
Tetsuo!

76
00:11:48,806 --> 00:11:51,683
Ryu! Where are you?

77
00:11:55,396 --> 00:11:56,271
Kei!

78
00:12:23,258 --> 00:12:24,800
No, that's......

79
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:46,572
How do you like that?

80
00:12:56,624 --> 00:12:58,750
Well? Who is it?

81
00:12:58,876 --> 00:13:01,253
It's not him.
It's not Tetsuo.

82
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:03,255
All right. Move out!

83
00:13:08,136 --> 00:13:13,098
Why you... What'd you do,
you weird little......

84
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:28,864
Tetsuo! Just hang on!

85
00:13:31,409 --> 00:13:32,576
What? What did you say?

86
00:13:32,702 --> 00:13:34,911
That kid......

87
00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:39,875
He's really hurt bad.

88
00:13:40,501 --> 00:13:42,628
Hey! You, there!

89
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:46,882
We gotta get him to a hospital!
He needs an ambulance!

90
00:13:46,924 --> 00:13:48,884
We can't move him!

91
00:13:57,518 --> 00:13:59,811
Wha...What the...!

92
00:14:14,702 --> 00:14:16,953
There's no escape.

93
00:14:22,377 --> 00:14:24,503
We're here to take you
back with us.

94
00:14:29,967 --> 00:14:33,512
You know we can't survive outside.

95
00:14:33,638 --> 00:14:35,180
Well, come along.

96
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:41,353
Army helicopters!
It's the army!

97
00:14:48,152 --> 00:14:49,528
Move out!

98
00:15:00,415 --> 00:15:02,124
Kiss the ground!
Hands on your heads!

99
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,460
We're, uh, innocent bystanders,
that's all.

100
00:15:05,586 --> 00:15:07,879
Kiss the ground!
Hands on your heads!

101
00:15:17,014 --> 00:15:19,391
That hurts, damn it.

102
00:15:19,517 --> 00:15:20,392
Kai!

103
00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:27,524
Soldier.

104
00:15:27,525 --> 00:15:28,358
- Sir.

105
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:29,693
- Sir.
- Who are those kids?

106
00:15:29,777 --> 00:15:32,195
They seem to be
an ordinary biker gang, sir.

107
00:15:47,336 --> 00:15:50,005
We're returning.

108
00:15:50,131 --> 00:15:52,215
- Ouch! Will you just hold on a minute?

109
00:15:52,216 --> 00:15:54,509
- Ouch! Will you just hold on a minute?
- My arms don't bend that way!

110
00:15:54,635 --> 00:15:57,429
Pull the wounded
onto the helicopter.

111
00:15:57,555 --> 00:16:01,349
Tetsuo! Hey, wait! You can't
take him away like that!

112
00:16:01,476 --> 00:16:02,517
Kaneda!

113
00:16:02,977 --> 00:16:05,854
What the hell are you guys doing?
We didn't do anything!

114
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,355
Get off!

115
00:17:07,542 --> 00:17:12,003
All right. The story is, you and your
friends went out at night...

116
00:17:12,129 --> 00:17:14,422
on your bikes to visit
your dying mother, and then...

117
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:18,343
another bunch of biker hooligans
called the Clowns attacked you.

118
00:17:18,636 --> 00:17:21,805
They hurt your friend, you lost your temper,
and that's why eight of these Clowns...

119
00:17:21,931 --> 00:17:25,517
your attackers...are all now in the hospital,
and that is the truth.

120
00:17:25,643 --> 00:17:27,811
Wow! She sure is hot.

121
00:17:28,312 --> 00:17:30,605
Hmm? This is confidential!

122
00:17:31,148 --> 00:17:32,315
And how's your mother doing?

123
00:17:32,483 --> 00:17:36,528
Fortunately, the worst is over.
She cleared the hump.

124
00:17:36,654 --> 00:17:39,781
She cleared the hump,
and you left her for cruising, huh?

125
00:17:39,907 --> 00:17:41,032
Wha...?

126
00:17:45,413 --> 00:17:47,622
Ah, these bozos couldn't
have anything to do with it.

127
00:17:47,748 --> 00:17:49,624
That goes without saying.

128
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,379
Wait out on that bench.
Do you understand?

129
00:17:57,008 --> 00:17:59,467
All right.
Send in the next five.

130
00:18:01,262 --> 00:18:03,471
So the army's working
with the police...

131
00:18:03,598 --> 00:18:06,558
to hunt down antigovernment
groups, or so it seems.

132
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,190
- You wanna put up a fight?

133
00:18:14,191 --> 00:18:15,358
- You wanna put up a fight?
- Get your hands off me!

134
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:24,743
Long live
the freedom revolution!

135
00:18:27,163 --> 00:18:29,497
He's got a grenade!

136
00:18:44,388 --> 00:18:47,766
All right, that's enough.
Get him back in there.

137
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:50,268
I'll teach him a lesson.
He won't forget.

138
00:18:50,394 --> 00:18:53,772
You dumb bastard!
If you wanna die, hang yourself!

139
00:18:54,398 --> 00:18:58,276
Listen, you kids are free to leave.
We've contacted your schools.

140
00:19:00,404 --> 00:19:01,613
Hold on a second, old man!

141
00:19:02,907 --> 00:19:04,366
Wha... "Old man"?

142
00:19:04,492 --> 00:19:05,951
There was someone else with us, you know.

143
00:19:06,369 --> 00:19:07,452
What was that?

144
00:19:07,578 --> 00:19:10,246
Excuse me, please?

145
00:19:10,373 --> 00:19:13,083
Huh? Hey!
What are you doing?

146
00:19:13,209 --> 00:19:16,086
Uh, it's this one right here.
Can't leave my friend.

147
00:19:16,212 --> 00:19:18,713
Don't ever call me "old man,"
you little punk!

148
00:19:19,256 --> 00:19:20,465
That's my foot !

149
00:19:20,591 --> 00:19:25,303
You listen here, kid. I'm only 25 years old.
I'm not even married yet.

150
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:29,641
Watch your mouth.
Get out of here and take your friend with you.

151
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:30,600
- I'm starving!

152
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:32,310
- I'm starving!
- I need a doctor!

153
00:19:32,436 --> 00:19:37,607
I think the army was chasing that weird kid
Kaneda saw. That's what I think.

154
00:19:37,733 --> 00:19:40,276
Yeah, you're right.
I think I saw him too.

155
00:19:40,403 --> 00:19:44,155
Speaking of Tetsuo, why the hell wouldn't they
tell us what hospital they threw him in?

156
00:19:44,448 --> 00:19:45,615
Huh? What was that?

157
00:19:46,075 --> 00:19:49,411
What I meant was
maybe we could go for a drink.

158
00:19:49,537 --> 00:19:52,747
I figure we could have a nice,
long chat about something you're into...

159
00:19:52,873 --> 00:19:55,000
like the whole revolution thing.

160
00:19:56,127 --> 00:19:58,670
I think you're a skirt chaser
who'll try anything he can.

161
00:19:59,255 --> 00:20:02,007
You'll help anyone so long as
it's a girl. Right?

162
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:03,174
You're wrong!

163
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:03,967
- I have very high standards.

164
00:20:03,968 --> 00:20:06,928
- I have very high standards.
- Line 'em up! Come on! Move it!

165
00:20:07,054 --> 00:20:09,431
It's not their looks that count.
It's their... I don't know......

166
00:20:09,557 --> 00:20:12,183
A girl's sensitivity
that makes me do it.

167
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:16,187
I suppose I owe you one.
Thank you very much, uh......

168
00:20:16,313 --> 00:20:17,814
- I'm Kaneda. It's nice to... Huh?

169
00:20:17,815 --> 00:20:19,190
- I'm Kaneda. It's nice to... Huh?
- See you around, Kaneda.

170
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:23,486
Wait a second!
You're leaving just like that?

171
00:20:23,612 --> 00:20:27,866
Hey! Now hold on. I'm the guy
that saved you back there.

172
00:20:31,328 --> 00:20:34,789
You could at least tell me
your name, you cold bitch!

173
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:41,212
Yes, I'll try talking with him,
but it's risky business.

174
00:20:41,338 --> 00:20:45,216
If they think you're avoiding responsibility,
the whole thing could blow up in your face.

175
00:20:46,761 --> 00:20:49,971
I can't believe that there's
a mole in the executive council.

176
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:51,890
Even if there is a mole......

177
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:54,392
That's not what's important here!

178
00:20:54,518 --> 00:20:58,730
What is are political maneuvers
and diplomacy which, apparently, you despise.

179
00:20:58,856 --> 00:21:01,232
I never studied the two subjects
in school, it would seem.

180
00:21:01,358 --> 00:21:04,235
In any case, at the next
executive council meeting...

181
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:06,988
your poor management and lack of
judgment on this last incident...

182
00:21:07,198 --> 00:21:09,407
will be called into question.

183
00:21:13,204 --> 00:21:14,746
There's a call for the colonel, sir.

184
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,251
Put your affairs in order,
if you want my advice.

185
00:21:23,214 --> 00:21:25,090
Yes, it's me. What is it now?

186
00:21:46,028 --> 00:21:48,571
This way, please, Colonel.

187
00:21:48,697 --> 00:21:53,743
I'm terribly sorry to call you here,
but there's something you really must see.

188
00:21:57,581 --> 00:21:59,457
Colonel, please look at this.

189
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:02,418
It's the special pattern
I'm getting from that young man.

190
00:22:02,545 --> 00:22:04,963
It doesn't resemble any
that I've seen so far...

191
00:22:05,089 --> 00:22:08,216
and I've never seen a developmental speed
or configuration like this.

192
00:22:08,342 --> 00:22:12,720
It may have begun with the shock of contact with
number 26, or it could be......

193
00:22:12,847 --> 00:22:15,807
Have you finished running the comparison
against Akira's pattern?

194
00:22:15,933 --> 00:22:18,393
I'll show you right now.

195
00:22:22,022 --> 00:22:25,650
This projection is made using
mixed data, and the results are not quite correct...

196
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:28,319
so a direct comparison is difficult.

197
00:22:28,445 --> 00:22:31,906
But I believe based on what we see here that
this boy's pattern is the key...

198
00:22:32,032 --> 00:22:35,285
to solving the riddle of
Akira's growth-pattern process.

199
00:22:35,411 --> 00:22:37,036
- Fine. You may continue.

200
00:22:37,037 --> 00:22:38,663
- Fine. You may continue.
- Thank you very much, sir.

201
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:42,167
I'm certain he'll turn out to be a worthy addition
to the numbers, don't you?

202
00:22:42,293 --> 00:22:45,170
It may be rough on the boy...

203
00:22:45,296 --> 00:22:48,756
but I thought we might try starting him off with
level 7 capsules.

204
00:22:48,883 --> 00:22:50,341
Is it safe, doctor?

205
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:51,676
I will take care of it.

206
00:22:51,802 --> 00:22:56,181
No! I wasn't talking
about the boy at all!

207
00:22:56,307 --> 00:22:59,309
If he turns out
to reach a power like Akira's...

208
00:22:59,435 --> 00:23:02,020
are you positive that you are
able to control such power?

209
00:23:02,146 --> 00:23:03,813
Uh, well, that's a......

210
00:23:04,815 --> 00:23:06,691
Can you handle this?

211
00:23:06,817 --> 00:23:09,194
Uh, well, then, in my opinion...

212
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,947
if we can use the latest examination equipment
to collect even more data...

213
00:23:13,073 --> 00:23:16,534
and also do a multifaceted
analysis as we go, then surely......

214
00:23:17,953 --> 00:23:22,040
But maybe we weren't meant to
meddle with that ultimate power.

215
00:23:22,499 --> 00:23:25,460
You mean...
the power of a god?

216
00:23:28,172 --> 00:23:30,840
"A-ki-ra."

217
00:23:30,966 --> 00:23:33,343
But we have no choice
but to grasp that power...

218
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:36,846
grasp that power
and learn to control it.

219
00:23:36,972 --> 00:23:40,058
And if this situation gets out
of hand, then he's to be terminated.

220
00:23:40,976 --> 00:23:42,977
- And without hesitation!

221
00:23:42,978 --> 00:23:44,562
- And without hesitation!
- Yes, Colonel.

222
00:23:45,022 --> 00:23:47,982
This school is
your last chance!

223
00:23:48,192 --> 00:23:50,568
If trash like you guys can't keep up with the
academic ability of regular students......

224
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:54,697
If you can't live a decent
social life, you end up here!

225
00:23:54,865 --> 00:23:57,033
And if you screw up here,
it's the end of the road!

226
00:23:57,117 --> 00:24:00,745
Also, even though you're under 15,
if you get more than 50 penalty points...

227
00:24:00,871 --> 00:24:02,997
you're sent to the
regular court.

228
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,250
Aw, bite me. Don't mess
with us, you bald old goat.

229
00:24:05,292 --> 00:24:07,252
Are you listening?

230
00:24:07,336 --> 00:24:08,544
- You lost me halfway through.

231
00:24:08,545 --> 00:24:09,879
- You lost me halfway through.
- Discipline!

232
00:24:10,005 --> 00:24:15,009
Discipline! Discipline!

233
00:24:15,135 --> 00:24:17,095
Discipline! Dismissed!

234
00:24:18,389 --> 00:24:21,891
Thank you very much, sir.

235
00:24:22,893 --> 00:24:26,062
- You loser! I'm gonna beat you up someday!

236
00:24:26,063 --> 00:24:27,272
- You loser! I'm gonna beat you up someday!
- We're gonna remember this!

237
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:28,564
- Yeah, you sick mother!

238
00:24:28,565 --> 00:24:31,276
- Yeah, you sick mother!
- Damn!

239
00:24:36,907 --> 00:24:38,199
Hi, Yamagata!

240
00:24:38,325 --> 00:24:40,702
What happened to your cheek?

241
00:24:40,744 --> 00:24:41,744
- Don't bother me.

242
00:24:41,745 --> 00:24:43,621
- Don't bother me.
- I heard you got into a fight.

243
00:24:43,747 --> 00:24:46,874
My friends told me you fought
the Clowns on the highway in the old city.

244
00:24:46,917 --> 00:24:47,625
Big deal.

245
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:50,461
Why didn't you wipe 'em out?
Those guys are so gross.

246
00:24:50,587 --> 00:24:53,798
Clowns, demonstrators,
cops, the damn army...

247
00:24:53,924 --> 00:24:55,967
and that idiot Tetsuo
had an accident!

248
00:24:56,093 --> 00:24:57,802
What happened to Tetsuo?

249
00:24:57,886 --> 00:24:59,637
He's in the hospital,
but we don't know where.

250
00:24:59,763 --> 00:25:01,723
Dumb loser was trying
to show off.

251
00:25:01,765 --> 00:25:02,974
Yeah, a real jerk.

252
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:06,477
Stupid idiot!

253
00:25:06,603 --> 00:25:08,438
- You're talking about Tetsuo, right?

254
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:09,731
- You're talking about Tetsuo, right?
- Shut up already!

255
00:25:09,857 --> 00:25:11,649
Why do you have to be hangin'
on my arm every minute?

256
00:25:11,692 --> 00:25:13,151
What the heck has got into you?

257
00:25:28,792 --> 00:25:32,170
Tetsuo, it's time
for your medicines.

258
00:25:33,464 --> 00:25:35,840
Doctor, hurry!
The boy is gone!

259
00:25:39,803 --> 00:25:44,682
No, I can't. You know the dorm mother always
throws a fit if you go out before 10:00.

260
00:25:44,808 --> 00:25:49,687
Yeah, you know, the one with a face like a goat?
That woman is such a pain.

261
00:25:49,813 --> 00:25:52,815
She's always complaining about us girls.
Huh? Tomorrow at 3:00?

262
00:25:52,941 --> 00:25:58,321
Yeah, that's cool. Hey, what
happened to that girl? You know who.

263
00:25:58,447 --> 00:26:02,325
I don't like her at all.
She gets on my nerves.

264
00:26:02,451 --> 00:26:03,326
Kaori!

265
00:26:05,454 --> 00:26:07,038
Tetsuo!

266
00:26:07,164 --> 00:26:11,793
Everyone's been worried about you.
They thought you were dead.

267
00:26:17,966 --> 00:26:22,720
When I woke up, I was on an
operating table or something.

268
00:26:22,846 --> 00:26:25,556
That examination... Ohh!

269
00:26:25,682 --> 00:26:28,726
It's like they were messing
around inside my head.

270
00:26:28,852 --> 00:26:33,231
No, I don't want to go back
there again. We'll run away.

271
00:26:33,357 --> 00:26:35,400
Where would we go to?

272
00:26:37,027 --> 00:26:41,572
I don't know. Someplace.
Someplace far away.

273
00:26:47,371 --> 00:26:48,996
Self study today!

274
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,581
Where'd the teacher go to?

275
00:26:50,707 --> 00:26:54,419
What about my burning desire
to study and learn a vocation?

276
00:26:54,545 --> 00:26:55,920
Drag his butt in here!

277
00:26:57,172 --> 00:26:59,340
- Kaneda! Hurry! Your bike!

278
00:26:59,341 --> 00:27:01,050
- Kaneda! Hurry! Your bike!
- What about my bike?

279
00:27:01,718 --> 00:27:03,261
See? Look down there!

280
00:27:05,347 --> 00:27:07,598
Wha... Tetsuo?

281
00:27:10,352 --> 00:27:11,727
- Is this okay?

282
00:27:11,728 --> 00:27:14,272
- Is this okay?
- Aw, quiet! Shut up and hang on!

283
00:27:25,826 --> 00:27:26,325
- Huh? What the......

284
00:27:26,326 --> 00:27:28,286
- Huh? What the......
- What's wrong?

285
00:27:28,412 --> 00:27:30,037
- Uuh! Aw, Shit!

286
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:31,122
- Uuh! Aw, Shit!
- Ooh!

287
00:27:31,248 --> 00:27:34,625
Oops, it's...stopping...
stopped......

288
00:27:35,752 --> 00:27:40,131
I get it. The engine can't drop below 5,000 R.P.M.S
even when you're changing the gears.

289
00:27:40,215 --> 00:27:41,174
- Ouch, my butt hurts.

290
00:27:41,175 --> 00:27:42,133
- Ouch, my butt hurts.
- I understand now.

291
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:43,885
Look, some bikes.

292
00:27:45,262 --> 00:27:49,307
Is that Kaneda and...
Wha... No, it isn't!

293
00:27:51,018 --> 00:27:53,978
Oh, shit! Kaori!

294
00:27:57,774 --> 00:27:58,649
Any sign of 'em?

295
00:27:59,234 --> 00:28:01,319
Kuwata and the others went
to go look around Kisarazu.

296
00:28:01,445 --> 00:28:04,780
The only place we haven't
searched now is the industrial area.

297
00:28:04,948 --> 00:28:06,324
Okay! Let's go!

298
00:28:09,077 --> 00:28:12,163
We owe you from the other night.
Now it's time for payback.

299
00:28:18,295 --> 00:28:19,420
Whoo-hoo!

300
00:28:20,797 --> 00:28:21,672
Shut up!

301
00:28:24,885 --> 00:28:27,011
Kaori! What happened?

302
00:28:33,977 --> 00:28:34,852
No, don't!

303
00:28:34,978 --> 00:28:39,190
If you put a single scratch on that bike,
I'm gonna kill you asshole!

304
00:28:41,944 --> 00:28:42,652
Huh?

305
00:28:45,155 --> 00:28:46,197
Run!

306
00:28:46,323 --> 00:28:48,282
After them!

307
00:28:54,122 --> 00:28:55,665
No, wait.

308
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:07,885
Tetsuo!

309
00:29:24,027 --> 00:29:26,487
You're gonna kill him, Tetsuo!
You want that?

310
00:29:26,613 --> 00:29:29,490
I want him more than dead!
I'll split his friggin' head open!

311
00:29:29,616 --> 00:29:31,325
Just knock it off now!

312
00:29:31,535 --> 00:29:36,038
This whole thing happened because
you took my bike for a spin. Enough already.

313
00:29:36,164 --> 00:29:39,208
Shut up! Don't order me around!

314
00:29:39,334 --> 00:29:41,335
We were just worried.

315
00:29:41,461 --> 00:29:44,171
Why do you always
have to try to save me?

316
00:29:45,716 --> 00:29:47,592
I could handle it on my own.

317
00:29:47,718 --> 00:29:53,681
I admit that I've gotten beaten before,
but I won't always be on the receiving end.

318
00:29:54,224 --> 00:29:55,766
Do you understand?

319
00:30:00,147 --> 00:30:01,022
Tetsuo......

320
00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:04,900
Shut up! Go away!

321
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:09,280
Hey, wait! Where're you going?

322
00:30:10,991 --> 00:30:11,949
Leave me alone!

323
00:30:14,828 --> 00:30:16,579
"Akira!"

324
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:21,125
Tetsuo!

325
00:30:24,171 --> 00:30:25,588
Something wrong?

326
00:30:26,506 --> 00:30:27,214
"Akira!"

327
00:30:27,424 --> 00:30:29,634
I don't know who that is!

328
00:30:51,615 --> 00:30:54,158
Tetsuo... What's wrong?

329
00:30:59,956 --> 00:31:04,335
This is really strange. I'm getting
a blue pattern on scope number 3.

330
00:31:04,461 --> 00:31:07,838
What? No! Retrieve the
subject now! Hurry!

331
00:31:21,645 --> 00:31:24,188
Why don't you guys
just leave my friend alone?

332
00:31:27,484 --> 00:31:32,113
What's with the getup, huh?
You goin' to a funeral?

333
00:31:38,286 --> 00:31:39,370
Tetsuo!

334
00:31:40,122 --> 00:31:41,122
Kaneda!

335
00:31:42,499 --> 00:31:43,874
Screw you!

336
00:31:53,343 --> 00:31:55,177
No, wait!

337
00:32:00,684 --> 00:32:03,144
Kaneda, what the hell's
goin' on?

338
00:32:12,863 --> 00:32:16,741
Well, well. I see we have
some real hip youngsters...

339
00:32:16,867 --> 00:32:20,244
doin' their thing in spite of the tight checkpoints
they got going around tonight.

340
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:23,748
And that just means that they're
all pretty stupid, doesn't it?

341
00:32:26,334 --> 00:32:28,544
This is boring.

342
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:31,046
Hey, what do you say?
Let's go home.

343
00:32:31,173 --> 00:32:33,549
What?
But it's still early.

344
00:32:33,675 --> 00:32:37,553
Yeah, but without their bikes,
they're just tail chasers outta water.

345
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,013
You mean "fish".

346
00:32:39,055 --> 00:32:41,724
Come on.
Let's go and toss these fish back.

347
00:32:42,476 --> 00:32:45,561
Hey, Kaneda.
What are we gonna do?

348
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:49,482
- What the heck?

349
00:32:49,483 --> 00:32:50,566
- What the heck?
- Look.

350
00:33:17,177 --> 00:33:18,385
That's......

351
00:33:18,512 --> 00:33:21,972
Here we go again. Look, let's get out of here
before we get caught up in it.

352
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:25,684
- Huh? Kaneda?

353
00:33:25,685 --> 00:33:26,977
- Huh? Kaneda?
- Hey!

354
00:33:28,438 --> 00:33:32,441
This area is being cordoned off
due to a terrorist bombing.

355
00:33:32,609 --> 00:33:34,902
Those who wish to get through,
line up in single file...

356
00:33:35,028 --> 00:33:37,905
present your I.D. and proceed
through the checkpoint.

357
00:33:48,708 --> 00:33:51,168
Get in.
What's wrong? Hurry.

358
00:33:51,294 --> 00:33:53,420
I'll meet you shortly.

359
00:33:53,547 --> 00:33:55,673
You know the rendezvous point, right?

360
00:33:57,425 --> 00:33:57,800
- Be careful.

361
00:33:57,801 --> 00:34:00,678
- Be careful.
- You too. You be careful.

362
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:15,693
Hey! Hold it right there!

363
00:34:17,654 --> 00:34:19,488
She's got a gun!

364
00:34:30,959 --> 00:34:34,378
Okay, that's far enough!
All right, drop it!

365
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,304
Drop it!

366
00:34:49,352 --> 00:34:50,561
Don't do it!

367
00:35:04,701 --> 00:35:06,535
- I think it came from over here.

368
00:35:06,536 --> 00:35:07,411
- I think it came from over here.
- There were two shots.

369
00:35:07,537 --> 00:35:09,246
No, three.
It's just up ahead!

370
00:35:10,498 --> 00:35:14,251
Hey! Let's get out of here.
Come on!

371
00:36:20,568 --> 00:36:21,652
Kaneda!

372
00:36:47,637 --> 00:36:51,348
There. Now what's the matter?
Talk about it.

373
00:36:51,474 --> 00:36:54,351
It was a dream that I saw.

374
00:36:54,477 --> 00:36:56,353
A dream?

375
00:36:57,814 --> 00:37:02,860
The city started to crumble apart,
covered by a big shadow.

376
00:37:02,986 --> 00:37:06,780
Lots of people died.
And the three of us...

377
00:37:06,906 --> 00:37:09,158
we get to meet Akira again.

378
00:37:09,826 --> 00:37:10,868
Wha... Akira?

379
00:37:11,411 --> 00:37:13,954
The city will crumble......

380
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,666
So many people...
So many will die.

381
00:37:17,792 --> 00:37:22,379
When will it happen?
Do you know when? Kiyoko!

382
00:37:22,505 --> 00:37:25,466
You mustn't let that boy go.

383
00:37:25,675 --> 00:37:27,885
His power, it......

384
00:37:35,268 --> 00:37:36,018
- What's she talking about?

385
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:37,644
- What's she talking about?
- Well, there's, uh......

386
00:37:37,771 --> 00:37:42,232
There seems to be nothing
physically wrong with her.

387
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:45,819
Her medication looks accurate.
There's no sign of any abnormalities...

388
00:37:45,945 --> 00:37:48,238
in her EKG or her EEG either.

389
00:37:48,364 --> 00:37:54,203
I think number 25's statement is probably
her precognitive power at work.

390
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:58,082
You know, this needs to be brought
before the supreme council for inquiry.

391
00:37:58,666 --> 00:38:00,250
Do you believe her?

392
00:38:00,376 --> 00:38:03,087
I have no doubts regarding
number 25's abilities.

393
00:38:03,213 --> 00:38:05,506
We have lots of data
that substantiate it.

394
00:38:05,632 --> 00:38:08,008
What do you believe, Colonel?

395
00:38:08,134 --> 00:38:13,514
I'll tell you, my job isn't to believe
or disbelieve. It's to act or not act!

396
00:38:26,152 --> 00:38:31,031
Here, sir. Cold gear, Colonel.
Please put it on. You too, doctor.

397
00:38:42,919 --> 00:38:47,548
The other day, a young researcher came to me
and asked me something.

398
00:38:47,674 --> 00:38:51,802
He wondered if their power was
the form of the next stage...

399
00:38:52,053 --> 00:38:56,306
that human evolution was taking, and perhaps
we would all be able to control it some day.

400
00:38:56,432 --> 00:38:59,810
Scientists are
a bunch of romantics.

401
00:39:00,103 --> 00:39:03,564
Military men, on the other hand,
always consider the risks first.

402
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:06,066
Over 30 years it's taken.

403
00:39:06,192 --> 00:39:09,736
We've come so far
crawling up from the rubble.

404
00:39:09,863 --> 00:39:12,072
We can't just trade one
for the other.

405
00:39:12,198 --> 00:39:15,284
But I've always thought that
you held a resentment...

406
00:39:15,285 --> 00:39:17,119
even a hatred for this city, Colonel.

407
00:39:17,287 --> 00:39:21,623
The passion to build has cooled,
and the joy of reconstruction forgotten.

408
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:26,086
Now... Now it's just a garbage heap made up of
a bunch of hedonistic fools.

409
00:39:26,212 --> 00:39:30,090
But in spite of that,
you're trying to save the city.

410
00:39:30,216 --> 00:39:33,635
I'm not a scientist.
I think like a soldier.

411
00:39:37,473 --> 00:39:39,349
Colonel, we're here, sir.

412
00:39:39,475 --> 00:39:41,351
This way, please.

413
00:40:01,497 --> 00:40:04,875
Room 10, 148 degrees Kelvin.

414
00:40:05,001 --> 00:40:08,212
Fluctuation tolerance range, check.

415
00:40:08,338 --> 00:40:10,380
Room 9, 118 degrees Kelvin.

416
00:40:10,506 --> 00:40:12,549
Fluctuation tolerance, check.

417
00:40:12,675 --> 00:40:15,010
Emergency power generator, check.

418
00:40:15,637 --> 00:40:16,470
- Open the door.

419
00:40:16,471 --> 00:40:18,222
- Open the door.
- Sir. Um...

420
00:40:18,348 --> 00:40:19,681
- The control room. Do it!

421
00:40:19,682 --> 00:40:20,474
- The control room. Do it!
- Yes, sir!

422
00:40:37,617 --> 00:40:41,912
Room 1 is at 0.0005 degrees Kelvin.

423
00:40:42,038 --> 00:40:45,999
It's within tolerance range.
No abnormalities detected in any of the rooms...

424
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:48,502
dewar walls or defense system.

425
00:40:48,628 --> 00:40:52,422
No abnormal atmospheric concentrations
or reactions recorded.

426
00:40:52,548 --> 00:40:54,925
So then all systems are normal.

427
00:41:03,851 --> 00:41:06,103
Look at what they abandoned
in their panic.

428
00:41:06,229 --> 00:41:10,190
They were afraid. They were too scared,
so they hid it away from the public...

429
00:41:10,316 --> 00:41:14,945
losing all sense of shame and honor,
casting aside the civilization...

430
00:41:15,071 --> 00:41:17,572
and abandoning the science
that created it.

431
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:22,119
Shutting the lid of the Pandora's
box they, themselves, had opened!

432
00:41:26,416 --> 00:41:27,082
- Ryu!

433
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:29,126
- Ryu!
- Hey, we're still young.

434
00:41:29,294 --> 00:41:29,543
- Ryu!

435
00:41:29,544 --> 00:41:31,420
- Ryu!
- We could start over again.

436
00:41:32,255 --> 00:41:33,588
- I'll go with you.

437
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:34,381
- I'll go with you.
- Ryu!

438
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:36,133
Turn yourself in!

439
00:41:36,259 --> 00:41:38,218
This was the first time
you killed a man, right?

440
00:41:38,261 --> 00:41:38,927
- Ryu!

441
00:41:38,928 --> 00:41:41,972
- Ryu!
- Anyway, when you get out...

442
00:41:42,265 --> 00:41:46,560
let's go out for drinks.
Don't kick yourself over it.

443
00:41:46,686 --> 00:41:50,480
What's done is done.
You've heard that.

444
00:41:56,529 --> 00:41:58,989
Identify yourselves!

445
00:42:00,074 --> 00:42:02,492
Ryu! Oh, are you all right?

446
00:42:02,618 --> 00:42:03,285
- Kei, it's you!

447
00:42:03,286 --> 00:42:04,661
- Kei, it's you!
- Ryu!

448
00:42:05,288 --> 00:42:06,997
Who's this?

449
00:42:07,457 --> 00:42:09,333
Who? Me?

450
00:42:09,459 --> 00:42:13,420
Well, I guess if I say that I'm Kei's
boyfriend, it's stretching it a bit.

451
00:42:13,463 --> 00:42:15,172
It depends on your point of view.

452
00:42:15,381 --> 00:42:17,799
But we haven't gotten
physical or anything.

453
00:42:17,967 --> 00:42:18,800
- You understand, don't you?

454
00:42:18,801 --> 00:42:19,468
- You understand, don't you?
- Are you a spy?

455
00:42:19,552 --> 00:42:20,135
- No, I'm not!

456
00:42:20,136 --> 00:42:21,178
- No, I'm not!
- You're lying!

457
00:42:26,142 --> 00:42:27,809
- Well, is he a spy or not?

458
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:30,687
- Well, is he a spy or not?
- Whatever he is, he's certainly not a spy.

459
00:42:31,064 --> 00:42:32,981
Ow!

460
00:42:34,484 --> 00:42:36,443
Sneak into their lab?

461
00:42:36,569 --> 00:42:39,279
Ridiculous!
Remember the fiasco with that kid?

462
00:42:39,405 --> 00:42:42,657
They're last-minute orders,
and the plan is in place already.

463
00:42:45,995 --> 00:42:48,372
These are the lab passes
they issue once a week.

464
00:42:48,498 --> 00:42:50,624
From Mr. Nezu, right?

465
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,626
What's the objective?

466
00:42:52,752 --> 00:42:55,045
We're to gather detailed
data on the new subject.

467
00:42:55,171 --> 00:42:56,922
- A new subject?

468
00:42:56,923 --> 00:42:58,048
- A new subject?
- Yes.

469
00:42:58,174 --> 00:43:03,053
Last week, on the same night we tried to abduct
the experimental subject called number 26...

470
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:07,891
a boy who was in an accident
on an old city highway was brought to the lab.

471
00:43:08,017 --> 00:43:10,852
It seems that he's a student
at a vocational training school...

472
00:43:10,978 --> 00:43:14,147
but now he's their new subject
for human experimentation.

473
00:43:14,273 --> 00:43:15,357
Huh?

474
00:43:18,277 --> 00:43:20,570
Ow, ouch!!

475
00:43:20,696 --> 00:43:23,490
Hey, hey, hey!
What's the big idea?

476
00:43:23,616 --> 00:43:24,699
You!

477
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,284
- Should I kill him? He heard us.

478
00:43:26,285 --> 00:43:26,993
- Should I kill him? He heard us.
- Ryu?

479
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,997
Wait! Now just hold on a minute!
Hear me out. Please listen to me!

480
00:43:31,124 --> 00:43:32,416
Ryu, he did save me.

481
00:43:32,542 --> 00:43:33,542
- Yeah! Twice!

482
00:43:33,543 --> 00:43:35,502
- Yeah! Twice!
- Maybe he did it just to get close to us.

483
00:43:35,628 --> 00:43:39,005
The guy who was in that accident
in the old city is my friend.

484
00:43:39,132 --> 00:43:42,259
I know it's hard for you to believe
what I'm saying, but it's the truth.

485
00:43:42,385 --> 00:43:44,344
I was right there when it happened!

486
00:43:45,388 --> 00:43:49,266
Come on! Don't they say
the only foolish questions are unasked ones?

487
00:43:50,435 --> 00:43:51,726
They don't?

488
00:43:53,521 --> 00:43:56,606
That's an intriguing story, isn't it?

489
00:43:56,732 --> 00:43:59,568
Well, will you be
taking the boy with you?

490
00:43:59,694 --> 00:44:03,697
He knows the subject and I think we can
use him as a decoy if we find it necessary.

491
00:44:03,823 --> 00:44:07,284
Neo Tokyo is going
to change soon.

492
00:44:08,161 --> 00:44:11,121
In all respects,
this city is saturated.

493
00:44:11,247 --> 00:44:13,290
It's like an overripe fruit.

494
00:44:13,416 --> 00:44:15,959
Buried within it is a new seed.

495
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:19,880
We need only wait for the wind
which will make it fall to fruition......

496
00:44:20,214 --> 00:44:22,299
The wind called "Akira".

497
00:44:23,593 --> 00:44:25,760
Ryu, look over here.

498
00:44:27,096 --> 00:44:28,263
What is it?

499
00:44:28,347 --> 00:44:30,724
We aren't the ones who will change it...

500
00:44:30,933 --> 00:44:33,894
but rather, those citizens
who hope for Akira that will.

501
00:44:35,271 --> 00:44:38,648
That which is called science
perverts providence!

502
00:44:38,774 --> 00:44:41,568
That which is called progress
encourages extravagance!

503
00:44:41,694 --> 00:44:45,155
That which is called civilization
devastates the spirit of man!

504
00:44:45,281 --> 00:44:48,909
The time of atonement is upon us!
Are your hearts prepared?

505
00:44:49,118 --> 00:44:53,497
The time is nigh!
The time of his awakening is nigh!

506
00:44:53,623 --> 00:44:56,833
The moment of lord Akira's
awakening is drawing closer!

507
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,043
- Are your minds prepared?

508
00:44:58,044 --> 00:45:00,128
- Are your minds prepared?
- Break it up!

509
00:45:00,129 --> 00:45:02,422
Holding meetings here
is prohibited.

510
00:45:02,465 --> 00:45:04,508
This gathering is illegal!

511
00:45:05,468 --> 00:45:09,429
Terrorist activities carried out
by antigovernment elements...

512
00:45:09,555 --> 00:45:11,181
have skyrocketed this month.

513
00:45:11,474 --> 00:45:15,769
The army, riot squad and even the traffic police
have been fully mobilized.

514
00:45:15,895 --> 00:45:18,855
The overtime costs alone have
used up the public safety budget.

515
00:45:18,981 --> 00:45:21,191
And then there's
the abduction of number 26.

516
00:45:21,317 --> 00:45:24,528
Isn't their existence supposed to be the highest
of state secrets, Colonel?

517
00:45:24,654 --> 00:45:28,031
No one's ever heard of peace
and order in Neo Tokyo then?

518
00:45:28,157 --> 00:45:32,035
And this, this request of yours
for further... Ah, yes...

519
00:45:32,161 --> 00:45:36,790
for further funding because of
subject number 25's prediction.

520
00:45:36,958 --> 00:45:41,211
You must be joking! While straightening out the
historic tax-reform blunders...

521
00:45:41,337 --> 00:45:44,381
of our former Prime Minister, we parliament members
have been bowing our heads down...

522
00:45:44,507 --> 00:45:46,716
and begging the public
to bear with us.

523
00:45:46,842 --> 00:45:51,888
And what does he ask for? Money!
Where, exactly, do we get that kind of money?

524
00:45:52,181 --> 00:45:53,723
You've already spent
a fortune here...

525
00:45:53,849 --> 00:45:56,560
and all we have to show for it
is that grotesque kindergarten!

526
00:45:56,852 --> 00:45:59,354
The Olympics is next year,
and the postwar period is over.

527
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:02,983
How much longer will you keep throwing
away money on these worthless ghosts?

528
00:46:03,109 --> 00:46:06,528
I always said we should put that
money into the welfare program!

529
00:46:06,612 --> 00:46:07,696
Shut up, old man!

530
00:46:07,697 --> 00:46:08,530
What was that?

531
00:46:08,614 --> 00:46:12,158
Now listen here! That power is starting
to walk around free as we speak.

532
00:46:12,285 --> 00:46:17,080
Unless we control that power now, we'll lose
everything we tried so hard to achieve.

533
00:46:17,206 --> 00:46:20,917
- Take that "old man" comment back!
- Your lack of policy started this mess!

534
00:46:21,127 --> 00:46:25,380
There's still no proof that the last world war was
caused by Akira, in my opinion.

535
00:46:25,548 --> 00:46:26,923
Don't you understand?

536
00:46:27,008 --> 00:46:31,428
Unless an Akira disaster actually happens...
Don't you people understand anything?

537
00:46:31,887 --> 00:46:34,347
Has anyone ever seen the "Akira"...?

538
00:46:34,515 --> 00:46:36,766
Akira was number 25, wasn't he?

539
00:46:36,976 --> 00:46:38,518
He should be number 21.

540
00:46:38,728 --> 00:46:41,771
I say that the colonel has lost
sight of his duty as a soldier!

541
00:46:42,982 --> 00:46:47,110
And I have had several reports on
antigovernment elements...

542
00:46:47,236 --> 00:46:51,239
how they're using your Akira madness
to whip up their terrorist fervor.

543
00:46:51,324 --> 00:46:52,949
It's not true. It's just not!

544
00:46:53,409 --> 00:46:55,577
Then what about that
Akira world renewal movement?

545
00:46:55,828 --> 00:46:57,704
Wouldn't you say that
information's being leaked?

546
00:46:57,913 --> 00:47:01,124
World renewal movement?
It's more like the end of the world.

547
00:47:01,417 --> 00:47:05,253
Aren't you just using Akira as camouflage
to cover up your misconduct? Admit it!

548
00:47:05,421 --> 00:47:06,963
What are you getting at?

549
00:47:07,173 --> 00:47:08,548
Colonel......

550
00:47:08,841 --> 00:47:15,805
Understand that we can no longer leave the
peace of Neo Tokyo to your sole discretion.

551
00:47:15,931 --> 00:47:16,973
Get rid of him!

552
00:47:17,016 --> 00:47:20,310
I'm sorry, but you are to be
put before an inquiry committee.

553
00:47:20,436 --> 00:47:21,645
He should be suspended!

554
00:47:25,441 --> 00:47:26,441
Excuse me!

555
00:47:26,776 --> 00:47:27,776
What?

556
00:47:28,611 --> 00:47:30,445
This discussion isn't over!

557
00:47:30,613 --> 00:47:31,696
- This is an outrage!

558
00:47:31,697 --> 00:47:33,448
- This is an outrage!
- You should explain yourself!

559
00:47:33,616 --> 00:47:35,992
Are you trying to insult
the supreme executive council?

560
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:02,477
Water.

561
00:48:35,636 --> 00:48:37,512
Hey. Wait a minute.

562
00:48:37,805 --> 00:48:41,224
Let's see. Isn't that cable
replacement due for next week?

563
00:48:41,517 --> 00:48:44,978
Well, the cable they ordered
came in a whole week early.

564
00:48:45,104 --> 00:48:49,232
And besides, I've got vacation time
coming, and I'm leaving this weekend.

565
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:52,026
If I bring the workers back,
there'll be overtime.

566
00:48:52,361 --> 00:48:56,823
I could leave now and come back,
but the work's gotta be done sooner or later.

567
00:49:02,037 --> 00:49:03,997
All right, guys. Let's go.

568
00:50:34,296 --> 00:50:35,338
What the...!

569
00:51:05,452 --> 00:51:07,287
It's milk.

570
00:51:14,962 --> 00:51:15,962
Stay away!

571
00:51:21,844 --> 00:51:23,720
- Whaa!
- Whoa!

572
00:51:29,351 --> 00:51:30,184
- It's blood!

573
00:51:30,185 --> 00:51:32,145
- It's blood!
- I'm scared.

574
00:51:40,321 --> 00:51:41,529
Weirdo!

575
00:51:41,697 --> 00:51:44,240
What? Those kids......

576
00:52:40,089 --> 00:52:43,299
"Patient, Room 887.
Shima, Tetsuo."

577
00:52:43,425 --> 00:52:45,885
Oh. The automatic lock's off?

578
00:52:51,016 --> 00:52:54,060
Hey, you! You're not
allowed to leave your room!

579
00:52:59,233 --> 00:53:00,817
Let's go back into your room.

580
00:53:00,943 --> 00:53:02,193
- What happened?

581
00:53:02,194 --> 00:53:03,778
- What happened?
- Looks terrible.

582
00:53:25,968 --> 00:53:30,179
There are 58 blocks with circuits
that the computer won't display.

583
00:53:30,305 --> 00:53:34,183
Of those, nearly 40 are concentrated
on underground levels 7 and 8.

584
00:53:34,309 --> 00:53:36,019
That's probably the place.

585
00:53:38,147 --> 00:53:41,024
The central wiring shaft
should be straight up ahead.

586
00:53:41,483 --> 00:53:44,193
We'll be able to use that to go
straight down to the sublevels.

587
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,489
Be careful.
It's deeper in the middle.

588
00:53:48,741 --> 00:53:50,158
Whew. What a stink.

589
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:51,367
Don't you ever stop talking?

590
00:53:51,452 --> 00:53:55,371
I said it stinks because it stinks.
Is your nose busted?

591
00:53:55,497 --> 00:53:57,123
Keep up and be quiet!

592
00:53:58,333 --> 00:54:00,543
Damn! Hug the walls!

593
00:54:00,669 --> 00:54:02,879
Huh?
What are you guys doing?

594
00:54:03,005 --> 00:54:05,298
You idiot, get down!

595
00:54:20,355 --> 00:54:22,231
Looks like they beefed up security,
doesn't it?

596
00:54:22,357 --> 00:54:23,608
- Must be that siren we heard.

597
00:54:23,609 --> 00:54:25,318
- Must be that siren we heard.
- Should we scout a way around it?

598
00:54:25,527 --> 00:54:26,944
- No. Let's keep going.

599
00:54:26,945 --> 00:54:28,071
- No. Let's keep going.
- Hey. Are you okay?

600
00:54:28,155 --> 00:54:31,157
I want to check their security
at the very least.

601
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,826
Damn! They spotted us!
Run for it!

602
00:54:35,871 --> 00:54:37,997
Don't shoot! Hold your fire!

603
00:54:41,543 --> 00:54:43,419
Shimazaki!

604
00:54:43,879 --> 00:54:45,505
- You assholes!

605
00:54:45,506 --> 00:54:47,173
- You assholes!
- Forget it! Run!

606
00:54:50,552 --> 00:54:52,261
What the hell is that thing?

607
00:54:54,056 --> 00:54:55,056
It's coming back!

608
00:54:56,016 --> 00:54:57,391
Don't shoot!

609
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,443
This is unit 304, Shaft "H".

610
00:55:07,569 --> 00:55:10,947
I have encountered intruders.
Requesting backup. Now engaging.

611
00:55:12,074 --> 00:55:13,783
Here it comes!

612
00:55:38,684 --> 00:55:40,393
Oh! Kei!

613
00:55:42,771 --> 00:55:44,897
The gun!

614
00:55:45,274 --> 00:55:46,899
Damn it!

615
00:55:49,444 --> 00:55:50,820
Kaneda!

616
00:56:00,789 --> 00:56:02,832
Kei! Over here!

617
00:56:03,792 --> 00:56:05,168
Now!

618
00:56:06,879 --> 00:56:09,088
Kaneda, come on! Hurry!

619
00:56:23,979 --> 00:56:25,271
Kaneda, no!

620
00:56:38,619 --> 00:56:40,620
What the hell...
Where are the brakes?

621
00:56:40,746 --> 00:56:42,413
- That's not it.

622
00:56:42,414 --> 00:56:44,624
- That's not it.
- This is the central wiring shaft, I think.

623
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:45,666
- I can't figure it out!

624
00:56:45,667 --> 00:56:46,626
- I can't figure it out!
- What the......

625
00:56:52,341 --> 00:56:54,550
There now.
That's right. Behave.

626
00:56:54,801 --> 00:56:57,345
Ask the colonel for clearance
on the use of firearms.

627
00:56:57,471 --> 00:56:59,222
Hey. Turn the radio up.

628
00:56:59,348 --> 00:57:00,973
There must be some mistake here.

629
00:57:01,016 --> 00:57:03,893
That boy looks like the patient
admitted in the lab.

630
00:57:04,019 --> 00:57:07,063
Correct. Tetsuo Shima.
He broke out of his ward.

631
00:57:07,189 --> 00:57:09,190
- He's headed for "the baby room".

632
00:57:09,191 --> 00:57:10,399
- He's headed for "the baby room".
- It's Tetsuo?

633
00:57:10,525 --> 00:57:15,821
He's extremely dangerous.
Do not let him through!

634
00:57:43,225 --> 00:57:45,226
Huh? What...?

635
00:57:52,567 --> 00:57:54,443
It's no use hiding anymore.

636
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:56,946
We have no choice, then.
Use your guns!

637
00:57:57,072 --> 00:58:00,449
We can't let him go any further,
no matter what it takes!

638
00:58:01,243 --> 00:58:02,285
Fire!

639
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:44,160
Good. All here, are you?

640
00:58:49,958 --> 00:58:51,125
Stop it!

641
00:58:53,628 --> 00:58:56,005
So how long are you gonna
keep playing around?

642
00:59:03,221 --> 00:59:04,847
Where's the other one
hiding, huh?

643
00:59:06,141 --> 00:59:07,641
Hey, you!
You're a cretin!

644
00:59:07,809 --> 00:59:08,642
Huh?

645
00:59:08,977 --> 00:59:10,353
Die!

646
00:59:13,231 --> 00:59:14,690
Takashi!

647
00:59:24,826 --> 00:59:29,830
What the hell is going on
with me? Am I dreaming?

648
00:59:30,165 --> 00:59:33,209
These powers, are they real
or just a hallucination?

649
00:59:40,842 --> 00:59:42,885
Damn it!
Where the hell am I going?

650
00:59:43,095 --> 00:59:46,389
Proceed straight.
Proceed straight ahead.

651
00:59:46,932 --> 00:59:47,807
Huh?

652
00:59:47,849 --> 00:59:49,892
You'll find a freight elevator just ahead.

653
00:59:52,187 --> 00:59:54,980
You can take it down
to sublevel 8.

654
01:00:03,198 --> 01:00:05,866
That's good.
You're all together.

655
01:00:07,202 --> 01:00:08,744
You thought you could kill me?

656
01:00:09,037 --> 01:00:10,746
I'm through with it.

657
01:00:10,872 --> 01:00:14,750
You tried to mess with me,
and now I'm gonna kill you!

658
01:00:15,127 --> 01:00:16,252
Huh?

659
01:00:20,882 --> 01:00:22,925
You were there. I remember.

660
01:00:23,301 --> 01:00:24,093
Takashi!

661
01:00:24,219 --> 01:00:24,718
- Huh?

662
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:26,262
- Huh?
- Together, let's attack him.

663
01:00:26,847 --> 01:00:27,847
O...Okay.

664
01:00:33,061 --> 01:00:35,020
You little twerps!

665
01:00:51,079 --> 01:00:53,038
All of you, that is enough!

666
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:03,716
Who the hell are you?

667
01:01:06,761 --> 01:01:09,472
What's the matter?
Is your head hurting?

668
01:01:09,598 --> 01:01:12,475
Tetsuo Shima, your power
isn't fully matured yet.

669
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:16,437
If you push yourself, you might do
irreparable damage. We can help.

670
01:01:16,688 --> 01:01:20,316
What the hell?
What...did you people do?

671
01:01:20,442 --> 01:01:21,817
You messed with my head!

672
01:01:30,202 --> 01:01:32,119
Tetsuo Shima, calm yourself.

673
01:01:32,245 --> 01:01:34,163
But he can't control it, sir.

674
01:01:39,544 --> 01:01:40,628
What'd you say?

675
01:01:40,795 --> 01:01:43,005
She said that big people
like you...

676
01:01:43,131 --> 01:01:45,841
should never use the power
in the way that you are.

677
01:01:45,967 --> 01:01:47,843
And bad things will come of it.

678
01:01:48,261 --> 01:01:50,638
Mind your own business,
will you?

679
01:01:53,391 --> 01:01:56,685
What?
More powerful than I am now?

680
01:01:59,314 --> 01:02:03,859
He's the one! He's the one who's been
invading my head all along!

681
01:02:04,152 --> 01:02:05,110
Where is he?

682
01:02:05,237 --> 01:02:07,154
Where's this "Akira"?
Tell me now!

683
01:02:07,322 --> 01:02:07,947
What?

684
01:02:08,073 --> 01:02:12,034
Kiyoko says you'll wake him up
and if you awaken Akira like that...

685
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,703
when that happens,
no one will be able to stop him.

686
01:02:14,829 --> 01:02:16,705
To prevent it,
we have to stop you.

687
01:02:17,082 --> 01:02:18,999
Ridiculous. Akira's already...!

688
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,043
Where is he?

689
01:02:23,296 --> 01:02:24,338
- No! Don't!

690
01:02:24,339 --> 01:02:25,464
- No! Don't!
- Stay back!

691
01:02:31,429 --> 01:02:35,224
Red level to facility integrity
has passed level 7.

692
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:38,227
Enacting disaster protocol.

693
01:02:39,437 --> 01:02:42,856
Red level to facility integrity
has passed level 7.

694
01:02:43,024 --> 01:02:45,901
Enacting disaster protocol.

695
01:02:46,486 --> 01:02:47,570
Wha...?!

696
01:02:54,869 --> 01:02:56,870
Hands up! Now!

697
01:02:59,499 --> 01:03:01,584
Where in the hell's
the friggin' baby room?

698
01:03:20,562 --> 01:03:22,855
Heads up!

699
01:03:22,981 --> 01:03:24,857
Coming through!

700
01:03:26,234 --> 01:03:27,776
Kiyoko.

701
01:03:48,256 --> 01:03:49,548
That hurt.

702
01:03:49,758 --> 01:03:50,633
Kaneda.

703
01:03:51,009 --> 01:03:53,135
What are you doing in here?

704
01:03:55,930 --> 01:03:58,807
Tetsuo! You okay?
I'm here to rescue you.

705
01:04:01,394 --> 01:04:03,228
Hurry up!
What are you, stupid?

706
01:04:03,355 --> 01:04:05,397
If we don't get
out of here, those...

707
01:04:06,107 --> 01:04:07,149
Huh?

708
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:09,818
There he is! Capture him!

709
01:04:11,446 --> 01:04:13,614
You keep away!

710
01:04:18,286 --> 01:04:19,453
Kaneda!

711
01:04:21,873 --> 01:04:24,333
Oh, that's right.
I forgot you were there.

712
01:04:26,461 --> 01:04:28,420
There. Do you see, Kaneda?

713
01:04:28,546 --> 01:04:32,299
I won't be needing you to come
to the rescue ever again, okay?

714
01:04:33,134 --> 01:04:36,011
From now on, I'll be in
charge of the heroics...

715
01:04:36,221 --> 01:04:39,306
so if you need any saving,
just ask, Kanny.

716
01:04:39,557 --> 01:04:43,852
Damn it, Tetsuo. Who the hell do you think
you're talking to, you moron?

717
01:04:44,813 --> 01:04:48,023
Ha! You don't like
what you're hearing, do you?

718
01:04:48,149 --> 01:04:51,360
Makes you angry. So what are
you gonna do now?

719
01:04:51,486 --> 01:04:54,697
Well, Kaneda?
What are you gonna do now?

720
01:05:04,666 --> 01:05:06,375
That's enough!

721
01:05:07,001 --> 01:05:09,878
Stop it!
Don't hurt anyone else!

722
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:13,382
Where's this Akira?

723
01:05:14,175 --> 01:05:15,050
I won't tell.

724
01:05:16,344 --> 01:05:19,054
Olympic stadium...
Underground.

725
01:05:19,514 --> 01:05:22,558
No! Don't! What you're
thinking is wrong! Akira is......

726
01:05:24,602 --> 01:05:25,811
Oh! Wait!

727
01:05:35,905 --> 01:05:36,947
What the hell?

728
01:05:37,782 --> 01:05:40,367
I can do this too?

729
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:48,542
Kiyoko, are you all right?

730
01:05:48,793 --> 01:05:50,377
It doesn't look like she's hurt.

731
01:05:50,545 --> 01:05:53,380
What about you, Masaru?
You're bleeding.

732
01:05:53,381 --> 01:05:54,882
Where'd he go to?

733
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:56,842
He flew away.

734
01:05:56,885 --> 01:05:59,011
How can he have so
much power?

735
01:06:01,473 --> 01:06:03,265
How could this have happened?

736
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:05,350
Damn it!
Where are my men at?

737
01:06:05,477 --> 01:06:09,021
He's developed so much power
in such a short time, it's unbelievable.

738
01:06:09,397 --> 01:06:11,523
Find him!
Start searching for Tetsuo.

739
01:06:11,816 --> 01:06:12,149
- Find him!

740
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:14,276
- Find him!
- Kaneda, come on! Get up!

741
01:06:15,236 --> 01:06:17,446
Somebody, help me
with this rock.

742
01:06:20,074 --> 01:06:21,575
- Tetsuo went to where Akira is.

743
01:06:21,576 --> 01:06:22,284
- Tetsuo went to where Akira is.
- What?

744
01:06:22,911 --> 01:06:25,788
That's good.
You're all safe.

745
01:06:25,914 --> 01:06:29,625
He's heading for the facility below
the Olympic construction site.

746
01:06:29,751 --> 01:06:31,794
How'd he find out about it?

747
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:38,884
Damn it! You're saying
that he's managed to escape?

748
01:06:42,388 --> 01:06:44,973
Then we'll follow him.
Prepare for pursuit!

749
01:06:45,183 --> 01:06:46,266
- He's heading west toward the stadium.

750
01:06:46,267 --> 01:06:48,310
- He's heading west toward the stadium.
- Come on! Move!

751
01:06:48,353 --> 01:06:51,647
I want additional checkpoints on all outbound
streets leading to the construction site.

752
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:53,816
It was you.

753
01:07:00,198 --> 01:07:02,074
According
to the security team...

754
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,827
reviews of tapes showed five
intruders disguised as workers...

755
01:07:04,953 --> 01:07:06,662
entering the wiring shaft.

756
01:07:06,788 --> 01:07:09,832
I have to stop him
before his powers mature.

757
01:07:12,210 --> 01:07:13,961
Your objective is the boy,
Tetsuo Shima.

758
01:07:14,212 --> 01:07:18,257
If we are unable to capture him,
we'll lure him out to the old city and attack.

759
01:07:18,383 --> 01:07:20,759
Request assistance from
the Eastern district battalion.

760
01:07:20,885 --> 01:07:21,468
- Yes, sir.

761
01:07:21,469 --> 01:07:23,971
- Yes, sir.
- Tell them there isn't a moment to lose here.

762
01:07:26,057 --> 01:07:28,016
I've been waiting here
a long time, Colonel.

763
01:07:29,269 --> 01:07:31,436
What are you doing here?

764
01:07:32,647 --> 01:07:36,859
I'm here to inform you of the supreme
executive council's decision.

765
01:07:38,611 --> 01:07:41,154
"At 2400 hours today,
the colonel is hereby..."

766
01:07:41,281 --> 01:07:43,156
"stripped of his command
and rank..."

767
01:07:43,283 --> 01:07:45,200
"and shall be placed
under arrest."

768
01:07:45,493 --> 01:07:47,202
What the hell?

769
01:07:47,495 --> 01:07:49,830
Kindly accompany us now.

770
01:07:50,081 --> 01:07:54,877
You really expect me to hand Neo Tokyo
over to those fools at a time like this?

771
01:07:56,462 --> 01:07:57,504
- Shoot him.

772
01:07:57,505 --> 01:07:58,338
- Shoot him.
- Yes, sir.

773
01:07:58,631 --> 01:08:01,717
What? No! Wait!
Hold on! No!

774
01:08:03,678 --> 01:08:07,180
Enough! Open your eyes
and look at the big picture!

775
01:08:07,307 --> 01:08:09,892
You're all puppets of corrupt
politicians and capitalists!

776
01:08:14,814 --> 01:08:18,233
Don't you understand?
It's utterly pointless to fight each other.

777
01:08:22,530 --> 01:08:27,075
Announce a state of emergency,
and arrest all members of the executive council.

778
01:08:27,201 --> 01:08:29,202
Break their chain of command.

779
01:08:29,329 --> 01:08:31,413
Lift off!
We're going after Tetsuo.

780
01:08:31,706 --> 01:08:33,415
Urgent message. Repeat, urgent.

781
01:08:33,541 --> 01:08:35,417
To all district
battalion commanders.

782
01:08:45,386 --> 01:08:49,097
Yo! What's up?
You're alone?

783
01:08:51,059 --> 01:08:53,936
That's right.
Weren't you in an accident?

784
01:08:54,062 --> 01:08:56,939
Your friends have been
really worried. You okay?

785
01:08:57,231 --> 01:08:59,691
Give me some...capsules.

786
01:09:00,026 --> 01:09:02,736
Huh? You sure
you want capsules, son?

787
01:09:02,862 --> 01:09:04,780
You look kinda woozy.

788
01:09:05,073 --> 01:09:06,782
You better get 'em now.

789
01:09:07,241 --> 01:09:08,116
All right.

790
01:09:08,242 --> 01:09:11,954
Whatever the customer wants, you know,
but with all those terrorist attacks lately...

791
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,581
and the demonstrations,
things are pretty rough.

792
01:09:14,832 --> 01:09:18,877
In fact, they're hard to come by, so the price
is pretty expensive, right?

793
01:09:25,093 --> 01:09:28,136
Tetsuo's run off somewhere,
Kaneda's disappeared.

794
01:09:28,262 --> 01:09:29,888
Damn, I guess
the team is finished.

795
01:09:29,931 --> 01:09:32,599
And the checkpoints are
so strict these days.

796
01:09:32,767 --> 01:09:34,977
Even the Clowns are
laying low.

797
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:45,195
Look!

798
01:09:49,283 --> 01:09:50,659
He's dead!

799
01:09:50,743 --> 01:09:51,576
What?

800
01:09:53,371 --> 01:09:55,247
Who's that?

801
01:10:01,129 --> 01:10:02,254
It's Tetsuo.

802
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:06,091
Why... Why are you here?

803
01:10:06,968 --> 01:10:09,594
Look who's here.
Wanna pop one?

804
01:10:09,971 --> 01:10:11,596
What the hell are you talking about?

805
01:10:11,723 --> 01:10:13,181
What happened here?

806
01:10:13,725 --> 01:10:15,851
Did you notice that
the owner's dead?

807
01:10:19,230 --> 01:10:22,024
An octopus out of water dies, huh?

808
01:10:22,316 --> 01:10:24,943
Are you...Tetsuo...

809
01:10:25,069 --> 01:10:26,486
- or someone else?

810
01:10:26,487 --> 01:10:27,195
- or someone else?
- Huh?

811
01:10:28,322 --> 01:10:30,365
Kaneda sends
his warmest regards.

812
01:10:30,491 --> 01:10:32,200
You saw Kaneda?

813
01:10:32,452 --> 01:10:34,453
He's probably dead by now.

814
01:10:37,498 --> 01:10:41,376
You did this, didn't you?

815
01:10:41,502 --> 01:10:45,881
All you're good for now is telling
me where Kaneda's bike is.

816
01:10:46,007 --> 01:10:47,549
Tetsuo!

817
01:10:47,675 --> 01:10:50,218
It's a piece of shit anyway.

818
01:10:50,344 --> 01:10:52,387
You son of a bitch!

819
01:10:57,518 --> 01:10:58,685
Yamagata!

820
01:11:05,318 --> 01:11:07,736
Goddamn it!

821
01:11:14,535 --> 01:11:16,328
So is he off to find Akira?

822
01:11:16,496 --> 01:11:18,413
Yes, that's what that girl was saying.

823
01:11:18,706 --> 01:11:20,665
Now, the army,
Ryu and yourself...

824
01:11:20,792 --> 01:11:23,001
are all trying at once
to find this Akira guy...

825
01:11:23,127 --> 01:11:25,253
and that's also why you're
chasing after Tetsuo.

826
01:11:25,505 --> 01:11:28,381
It must have to do
with the powers he's got.

827
01:11:28,508 --> 01:11:31,510
What the hell is this Akira thing?

828
01:11:34,222 --> 01:11:36,598
I asked Ryu one time.

829
01:11:36,724 --> 01:11:39,851
He told me that Akira
is ultimate energy.

830
01:11:40,019 --> 01:11:41,770
"Ultimate energy"?

831
01:11:41,896 --> 01:11:45,941
Humans do all kinds of things
during their lifetime, right?

832
01:11:46,067 --> 01:11:48,110
Discover things......

833
01:11:48,236 --> 01:11:50,695
Build things......

834
01:11:50,822 --> 01:11:53,115
Things like houses, motorcycles...

835
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:57,452
bridges and cities, rockets......

836
01:11:58,246 --> 01:12:01,456
So where do you suppose all that
knowledge and energy comes from?

837
01:12:03,709 --> 01:12:06,461
Humans were once
like monkeys, right?

838
01:12:07,171 --> 01:12:09,131
And before that,
like reptiles...

839
01:12:09,257 --> 01:12:10,882
and fish...

840
01:12:10,925 --> 01:12:14,469
and even before that,
plankton and amoebas.

841
01:12:14,595 --> 01:12:18,974
Even little creatures like those
have incredible amount of energy inside them.

842
01:12:19,392 --> 01:12:22,644
Oh, yes...
It's in the genes, right?

843
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:24,646
And even before that.

844
01:12:24,772 --> 01:12:27,983
Maybe there was genetic
material in the air and water...

845
01:12:28,109 --> 01:12:29,985
even in the particles
of dust in space.

846
01:12:30,403 --> 01:12:34,739
And if that's the truth, then what sort of memories
are hidden within them?

847
01:12:34,949 --> 01:12:38,827
The beginning of the universe?
Or maybe even before that.

848
01:12:38,953 --> 01:12:42,831
What's with all the crazy talk?
Are you sure you're okay?

849
01:12:42,957 --> 01:12:45,292
Listen to yourself. Did you get
bonked on the head back there?

850
01:12:45,585 --> 01:12:48,837
And what if everyone shares
those ancient memories?

851
01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:52,132
What if there were some mistakes
in the progression?

852
01:12:52,258 --> 01:12:54,801
Then something goes wrong,
like an amoeba is suddenly given...

853
01:12:54,927 --> 01:12:57,012
the higher powers
that a human has.

854
01:12:58,556 --> 01:13:00,307
Akira is an amoeba then?

855
01:13:01,309 --> 01:13:04,019
Amoebas don't build their own
houses and bridges, do they?

856
01:13:04,395 --> 01:13:07,105
They just devour all the food
they can find around them.

857
01:13:07,315 --> 01:13:09,482
Is that what Tetsuo's doing?

858
01:13:09,609 --> 01:13:11,610
Are you saying he has
that kind of energy?

859
01:13:11,986 --> 01:13:13,695
Long ago...

860
01:13:13,821 --> 01:13:16,990
there were people who tried
to gain control of that power.

861
01:13:17,116 --> 01:13:19,159
That is, all of the government's
requests.

862
01:13:19,327 --> 01:13:23,663
But they failed in their attempt,
and it triggered the fall of Tokyo.

863
01:13:24,749 --> 01:13:26,625
And that power is...

864
01:13:26,751 --> 01:13:28,710
something that is
totally beyond our......

865
01:13:30,671 --> 01:13:31,630
Wha...!

866
01:13:32,506 --> 01:13:33,673
The door's unlocked.

867
01:13:37,511 --> 01:13:38,637
Huh?

868
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:47,187
It's a trap.
This is just too good of a setup.

869
01:13:47,313 --> 01:13:48,188
- Go back, then.

870
01:13:48,189 --> 01:13:49,189
- Go back, then.
- No way.

871
01:13:49,315 --> 01:13:51,816
I wanna find out how much
of a trap it is, don't you?

872
01:13:53,778 --> 01:13:55,737
By the way...

873
01:13:55,863 --> 01:13:58,573
what's going on with you
and that Ryu guy?

874
01:13:58,699 --> 01:14:00,367
What in the world
are you talking about?

875
01:14:00,534 --> 01:14:01,493
- You're always together.

876
01:14:01,494 --> 01:14:03,161
- You're always together.
- That's none of your business.

877
01:14:04,497 --> 01:14:06,081
No, wait. Hear me out.

878
01:14:06,290 --> 01:14:09,167
What I'm saying is, he doesn't
know about us, does he?

879
01:14:09,377 --> 01:14:13,505
"About us"? Hey, wait a minute.
What's that supposed to mean?

880
01:14:13,673 --> 01:14:15,215
- Do you think it'll work?

881
01:14:15,216 --> 01:14:17,008
- Do you think it'll work?
- It can't be helped.

882
01:14:17,134 --> 01:14:21,388
At this point in time, our only
option left is to use her.

883
01:14:21,514 --> 01:14:23,598
Well, the fact that,
without us even looking...

884
01:14:23,724 --> 01:14:26,268
she turned up right under
our noses, says as much.

885
01:14:26,394 --> 01:14:28,395
- What do you think?

886
01:14:28,396 --> 01:14:29,562
- What do you think?
- I guess so.

887
01:14:43,911 --> 01:14:47,789
We have arrived at ward 13,
East Ginza intersection. Over.

888
01:14:47,915 --> 01:14:50,542
Northern district battalion has not
responded to mobilization request!

889
01:14:51,419 --> 01:14:53,962
Special search team to H.Q.
Special search team to H.Q.

890
01:14:54,255 --> 01:14:57,549
We're at the Harukiya bar near
the highway interchange at ward 8.

891
01:14:57,717 --> 01:15:01,469
It doesn't look like a bomb explosion
to us, so we think it was him.

892
01:15:01,595 --> 01:15:04,055
No, sir, it wasn't
a gas explosion either.

893
01:15:04,348 --> 01:15:07,475
It was almost certainly the work of
the subject that escaped from the lab.

894
01:15:08,436 --> 01:15:10,312
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Understood.

895
01:15:16,569 --> 01:15:18,820
Kaneda, wait!

896
01:15:19,947 --> 01:15:22,324
What? Yamagata's dead?

897
01:15:22,575 --> 01:15:25,452
Something seemed strange about him
the second I saw his face.

898
01:15:25,578 --> 01:15:28,163
It's odd. He was wearing what
looked like a white hospital gown.

899
01:15:28,289 --> 01:15:30,332
He acted like a different person.

900
01:15:31,792 --> 01:15:34,336
Yamagata asked him
if he was really Tetsuo...

901
01:15:34,378 --> 01:15:35,920
or if he was someone else.

902
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:40,842
And then he... Yamagata!
Why?

903
01:15:43,888 --> 01:15:46,014
We've always been together.

904
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:48,183
I've known everything
about him ever...

905
01:15:50,311 --> 01:15:52,854
ever since we were
in the children's home together.

906
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:56,524
They tease... Everybody
tried to make him cry.

907
01:15:58,152 --> 01:16:01,363
Oh. He really wanted to know
where your bike was at.

908
01:16:01,989 --> 01:16:04,199
Where my bike was?

909
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,459
What are you gonna do?

910
01:16:15,002 --> 01:16:17,379
I'm gonna go send
Yamagata his wheels.

911
01:16:22,009 --> 01:16:24,386
You dumb bastard!

912
01:16:27,807 --> 01:16:29,182
Kaneda!

913
01:16:45,449 --> 01:16:46,408
Kei!

914
01:16:46,867 --> 01:16:48,076
What's wrong?

915
01:16:52,373 --> 01:16:54,874
That night. You were there.

916
01:16:58,879 --> 01:17:00,213
Wait!

917
01:17:06,053 --> 01:17:07,220
Kei!

918
01:17:11,475 --> 01:17:12,934
They're gone!

919
01:17:14,353 --> 01:17:17,439
You're the one, right?
You changed my friend, didn't you?

920
01:17:17,690 --> 01:17:19,399
The thing about Akira's power is...

921
01:17:19,525 --> 01:17:22,110
it exists within everyone
from the start.

922
01:17:22,236 --> 01:17:23,778
Hey, who is that?

923
01:17:25,239 --> 01:17:27,866
But when that power
is awakened inside...

924
01:17:27,992 --> 01:17:31,286
it is important to wisely
choose how to use it.

925
01:17:31,745 --> 01:17:34,122
When the time comes,
you might not know it...

926
01:17:34,248 --> 01:17:36,416
let alone be prepared for it.

927
01:17:37,418 --> 01:17:40,295
Your friend
has already made his choice.

928
01:17:41,922 --> 01:17:43,965
Tetsuo is our newest companion.

929
01:17:44,091 --> 01:17:46,134
He's our friend also.

930
01:17:47,428 --> 01:17:49,304
His actions are out of control...

931
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:51,306
and for that
we're partly to blame too.

932
01:17:51,599 --> 01:17:54,309
Great! Then what in the hell
did you take Kei for?

933
01:17:54,602 --> 01:17:57,312
We're hoping she'll be able
to help us in some way.

934
01:17:57,605 --> 01:18:00,648
They're people, not toys!
Bring her back to me!

935
01:18:00,774 --> 01:18:02,817
And Tetsuo's our friend,
not yours!

936
01:18:02,943 --> 01:18:04,986
If someone's gonna kill him,
it should be us!

937
01:18:07,781 --> 01:18:08,823
Hey!

938
01:18:11,744 --> 01:18:15,830
Are you sure? Mr. Omi and the others
have been arrested in the coup d'etat?

939
01:18:16,123 --> 01:18:20,335
Yes, that's right. The house guards
are fighting them right now.

940
01:18:20,461 --> 01:18:24,506
Yes. I'd like to have
a helicopter waiting. Yes.

941
01:18:26,091 --> 01:18:29,093
That damn Colonel! I can't
believe he's taken up arms.

942
01:18:31,805 --> 01:18:33,765
I've underestimated him.

943
01:18:38,312 --> 01:18:40,188
Hold them here!

944
01:19:10,761 --> 01:19:13,137
Mr. Nezu, I......

945
01:19:13,514 --> 01:19:16,140
Oh! Ryu, is that you?

946
01:19:16,433 --> 01:19:18,393
I came to apologize, sir.

947
01:19:18,519 --> 01:19:20,728
The mission was a failure.

948
01:19:21,021 --> 01:19:24,857
Damn you! I told you,
you can't be seen here!

949
01:19:26,485 --> 01:19:29,070
My two best men, they're dead.

950
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,572
Everyone was killed.

951
01:19:30,656 --> 01:19:33,700
You bastard! You sold me out!

952
01:19:33,826 --> 01:19:35,201
What?

953
01:19:38,372 --> 01:19:39,706
Kei!

954
01:19:53,345 --> 01:19:54,554
What?

955
01:19:54,847 --> 01:19:56,556
Yeah, 7th avenue
is just up ahead.

956
01:19:56,682 --> 01:19:59,601
It intersects this road
a hundred meters from here.

957
01:20:03,564 --> 01:20:05,189
Battle stations!

958
01:20:13,574 --> 01:20:17,076
Right! The subject
has been spotted.

959
01:20:17,202 --> 01:20:19,537
What? Attack the kid?

960
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:23,291
But, sir, he's just a boy!
We can't attack him!

961
01:20:27,755 --> 01:20:28,880
- Look! There he is!

962
01:20:28,881 --> 01:20:29,797
- Look! There he is!
- It's impossible.

963
01:20:29,882 --> 01:20:31,049
Is this for real?

964
01:20:42,728 --> 01:20:44,562
Fire range preparations
are complete.

965
01:20:47,274 --> 01:20:49,067
Damn it! Fire!

966
01:21:02,081 --> 01:21:04,749
Is it Akira?

967
01:21:04,875 --> 01:21:06,751
Look, it's Lord Akira!

968
01:21:07,628 --> 01:21:09,629
Don't be fooled! This isn't the rapture!

969
01:21:09,755 --> 01:21:11,172
He's a false messiah!

970
01:21:13,133 --> 01:21:15,635
Long live Akira!

971
01:21:16,136 --> 01:21:17,512
Fire!

972
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:19,722
- What the......

973
01:21:19,723 --> 01:21:21,015
- What the......
- What's wrong?

974
01:22:48,562 --> 01:22:51,272
Coming to you live aboard news
chopper 1 high over downtown.

975
01:22:51,398 --> 01:22:54,275
Neo Tokyo broadcasting is exclusively
covering the news today...

976
01:22:54,401 --> 01:22:57,111
in spite of martial law, in the
name of freedom of the press.

977
01:22:57,196 --> 01:22:59,614
What in the world is happening
here in Neo Tokyo?

978
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:02,784
What you see here seem to be
fires caused by tank cannons.

979
01:23:02,910 --> 01:23:07,288
But who is this boy standing alone?
Is he fighting the coup d'etat forces by himself?

980
01:23:07,748 --> 01:23:09,457
I'm sorry.
We've been ordered to land.

981
01:23:09,583 --> 01:23:11,793
The army has just illegally
ordered us to land!

982
01:23:11,919 --> 01:23:15,254
What is at stake here is freedom of
the press! We've been ordered to...

983
01:23:16,256 --> 01:23:17,590
- Did they just get cut off?

984
01:23:17,591 --> 01:23:18,716
- Did they just get cut off?
- What was that?

985
01:23:18,842 --> 01:23:21,135
The bridge!
He's heading for the bridge!

986
01:23:40,948 --> 01:23:42,782
Are you sure you want
to do this alone?

987
01:23:43,784 --> 01:23:45,785
This is what he wants,
isn't it?

988
01:23:46,411 --> 01:23:48,830
At least give me time
to get the gang together.

989
01:23:49,414 --> 01:23:50,957
Hey, wait!

990
01:23:51,083 --> 01:23:53,417
I wouldn't want to keep him
waiting now, would I?

991
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:57,338
Hey, Kaneda, hold on!

992
01:24:03,971 --> 01:24:07,306
Half of them seem to be antigovernment
demonstrators. The rest are......

993
01:24:07,391 --> 01:24:11,519
They're more like some
crazy cult than onlookers.

994
01:24:11,645 --> 01:24:14,814
They're following after the subject,
and more and more keep coming.

995
01:24:17,985 --> 01:24:19,986
Flames of supreme purity...

996
01:24:20,112 --> 01:24:22,613
rain down and raze
the corrupt city...

997
01:24:22,739 --> 01:24:26,200
and drown forever all the
unclean believers of our time!

998
01:24:26,326 --> 01:24:28,202
Give yourselves
into the flame, children...

999
01:24:28,328 --> 01:24:30,496
and all of you
shall be reborn again!

1000
01:24:30,622 --> 01:24:32,498
Now consume our heart.

1001
01:24:32,624 --> 01:24:35,334
Wash our unclean hearts
in the eternal fire!

1002
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:38,629
Your body is going to be
purified in the flames!

1003
01:24:39,464 --> 01:24:41,299
Ready!

1004
01:24:42,009 --> 01:24:42,508
- What?

1005
01:24:42,509 --> 01:24:43,718
- What?
- Fire!

1006
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:52,560
Set the switch to hold for 3 seconds.
Then converge your beams.

1007
01:24:53,687 --> 01:24:55,730
Aim, fire!

1008
01:25:01,862 --> 01:25:03,738
Watch this!

1009
01:25:09,870 --> 01:25:12,413
Look out!
Let's get out of here!

1010
01:25:21,048 --> 01:25:24,091
Save me!

1011
01:25:30,891 --> 01:25:33,434
Ground forces.
Ground forces, come in.

1012
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:35,603
Report immediately.
What is the subject's status?

1013
01:25:35,854 --> 01:25:37,897
Do you read?

1014
01:25:39,066 --> 01:25:40,733
Line to the doctor.

1015
01:25:40,901 --> 01:25:44,111
We have confirmation of his recent
movements and are in pursuit.

1016
01:25:44,237 --> 01:25:46,572
His present position is...

1017
01:25:46,657 --> 01:25:51,118
coordinates 99871 by 4332.

1018
01:25:51,745 --> 01:25:54,622
That's about 2 kilometers south of
the Olympic construction site...

1019
01:25:54,748 --> 01:25:55,790
in the old city.

1020
01:25:55,916 --> 01:25:56,749
What?

1021
01:26:02,214 --> 01:26:04,090
Where did that blast
come from?

1022
01:26:04,216 --> 01:26:05,174
- Look!

1023
01:26:05,175 --> 01:26:06,050
- Look!
- Huh?

1024
01:26:06,218 --> 01:26:10,054
That must be out over at the tollbooth
being guarded by the second platoon.

1025
01:26:11,723 --> 01:26:13,224
What the hell?

1026
01:26:16,436 --> 01:26:20,314
Please turn around now.
This area is off-limits to civilians.

1027
01:26:20,399 --> 01:26:23,442
Huh? What? That's
the escaped subject? Stop!

1028
01:26:23,610 --> 01:26:25,820
Don't come any closer!
Stop, damn it!

1029
01:27:30,635 --> 01:27:34,180
Nice place you have here, isn't it?

1030
01:27:41,188 --> 01:27:44,356
You are the girl
that was with Kaneda.

1031
01:27:44,483 --> 01:27:48,402
You shouldn't use your power in this way,
for it is not correct.

1032
01:27:48,528 --> 01:27:50,154
What's that?

1033
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:54,909
Because in the end, you won't be able to
control it, and it will control you.

1034
01:27:55,035 --> 01:27:57,995
It's the kids talking.
You're those brats, right?

1035
01:28:16,223 --> 01:28:18,265
Nice one!

1036
01:28:39,871 --> 01:28:41,789
What's going on?

1037
01:28:52,259 --> 01:28:53,801
It's not safe here, Colonel!

1038
01:29:34,968 --> 01:29:37,344
All right now. Next move.

1039
01:31:04,557 --> 01:31:05,933
Open now!

1040
01:31:16,903 --> 01:31:18,946
What the hell is this?

1041
01:31:19,030 --> 01:31:21,699
That is Akira before you,
Tetsuo.

1042
01:31:21,825 --> 01:31:23,784
That's the Akira
you wanted to meet!

1043
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:27,746
There is your messiah, the chosen one that
you've been looking for.

1044
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:30,624
Not long after
his transcendental awakening...

1045
01:31:30,750 --> 01:31:33,961
his organs and tissues were subjected to
every test known to modern science.

1046
01:31:34,087 --> 01:31:36,964
He's dead. That's it.

1047
01:31:37,090 --> 01:31:39,550
What you see there
is all that's left of him.

1048
01:31:48,435 --> 01:31:50,644
And all of the scientists
back then...

1049
01:31:50,770 --> 01:31:52,771
were unable to solve
the mystery...

1050
01:31:52,897 --> 01:31:56,900
so they decided to entrust
all of their collected data and test samples...

1051
01:31:56,943 --> 01:32:00,404
to future generations by preserving them
in frozen capsules and locking them away.

1052
01:32:02,615 --> 01:32:04,116
- SOL. We will use SOL.

1053
01:32:04,117 --> 01:32:04,825
- SOL. We will use SOL.
- Huh?

1054
01:32:07,454 --> 01:32:10,164
Akira has been dead all this time.

1055
01:32:10,582 --> 01:32:13,334
Well, are you satisfied now,
Tetsuo?

1056
01:32:18,465 --> 01:32:20,632
Now will you return with us?

1057
01:32:21,092 --> 01:32:22,468
Like hell!

1058
01:32:23,470 --> 01:32:25,679
Contact the central
defense center...

1059
01:32:25,805 --> 01:32:29,475
and tell them to patch us through
into SOL's main control circuits right away!

1060
01:32:46,993 --> 01:32:48,285
Hey, watch it, you jerk!

1061
01:32:48,411 --> 01:32:52,373
Move! Get out of the way!
Move it!

1062
01:33:08,681 --> 01:33:11,725
What is this,
a science classroom?

1063
01:33:21,861 --> 01:33:22,986
Huh?

1064
01:33:28,701 --> 01:33:31,412
What's wrong?
Have some trouble?

1065
01:33:31,538 --> 01:33:35,374
Yeah, but I already
took care of it.

1066
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:37,418
And you're too late.
You missed the show.

1067
01:33:37,544 --> 01:33:40,003
Tetsuo,
you had me worried again.

1068
01:33:40,130 --> 01:33:43,215
I figured you'd be standing here,
sobbing like a little baby.

1069
01:33:43,675 --> 01:33:47,928
Kaneda. You've always been
a pain in the ass, you know.

1070
01:33:48,346 --> 01:33:51,098
You've been telling me
what to do since we were kids!

1071
01:33:51,182 --> 01:33:53,100
You always treat me like a kid.

1072
01:33:53,226 --> 01:33:58,230
You always show up and start
bossing me around, and don't you deny it!

1073
01:33:58,356 --> 01:34:02,234
And now you're a boss, too,
of this pile of rumble.

1074
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:03,735
- Kaneda!

1075
01:34:03,736 --> 01:34:06,113
- Kaneda!
- That's "Mister" Kaneda to you, punk!

1076
01:34:06,239 --> 01:34:08,198
Die!

1077
01:34:18,209 --> 01:34:19,376
Tetsuo!

1078
01:34:42,775 --> 01:34:44,735
Son of a bitch!

1079
01:34:58,458 --> 01:34:59,416
Kei!

1080
01:35:01,461 --> 01:35:02,920
Oh, damn it!

1081
01:35:06,466 --> 01:35:08,509
Let's do it!

1082
01:35:19,771 --> 01:35:21,688
Gotcha!

1083
01:35:22,482 --> 01:35:23,690
What?

1084
01:35:23,983 --> 01:35:24,816
Huh?

1085
01:35:26,986 --> 01:35:29,530
Huh?
The damn battery's dead!

1086
01:35:29,656 --> 01:35:32,115
What's the matter now, Kaneda?

1087
01:35:33,618 --> 01:35:34,785
Damn it!

1088
01:35:34,911 --> 01:35:37,621
It ain't fair, Tetsuo!
Fight with your bare hands!

1089
01:35:41,125 --> 01:35:42,167
Oh, this is funny!

1090
01:35:44,295 --> 01:35:46,505
Feeling frustrated, Kaneda?

1091
01:35:46,631 --> 01:35:49,883
Now do you understand how it feels
being little and helpless?

1092
01:35:52,512 --> 01:35:53,554
Oh?

1093
01:35:56,015 --> 01:35:58,392
Where's this light coming from?

1094
01:36:09,195 --> 01:36:10,112
- Were we on target?

1095
01:36:10,113 --> 01:36:12,030
- Were we on target?
- Hard to tell. Too close to the impact point.

1096
01:36:12,156 --> 01:36:13,031
- The monitors are getting too much electrical...

1097
01:36:13,032 --> 01:36:14,866
- The monitors are getting too much electrical...
- Prepare a second volley, now!

1098
01:36:37,557 --> 01:36:40,058
Hey!

1099
01:36:40,184 --> 01:36:42,102
Kaneda!

1100
01:37:00,204 --> 01:37:03,624
Tetsuo!

1101
01:37:18,514 --> 01:37:19,931
Shit!

1102
01:37:21,267 --> 01:37:23,060
What the......

1103
01:37:27,523 --> 01:37:29,316
Wh...!

1104
01:37:58,888 --> 01:38:00,764
Correcting error now
on tracking system.

1105
01:38:00,890 --> 01:38:02,766
T minus 20...

1106
01:38:02,892 --> 01:38:04,518
Get the fire extinguishers!
Are you okay?

1107
01:38:04,602 --> 01:38:05,435
- Get that fire out!

1108
01:38:05,436 --> 01:38:07,312
- Get that fire out!
- What's going on?

1109
01:38:16,614 --> 01:38:18,115
Kaneda!

1110
01:38:19,659 --> 01:38:21,326
Kai! Kei!

1111
01:38:21,452 --> 01:38:21,827
- Kaneda!

1112
01:38:21,828 --> 01:38:22,536
- Kaneda!
- Kaneda!

1113
01:38:22,829 --> 01:38:23,704
Get on!

1114
01:38:23,788 --> 01:38:24,830
- Where?

1115
01:38:24,831 --> 01:38:26,206
- Where?
- Hurry!

1116
01:38:48,354 --> 01:38:50,355
What is that?

1117
01:39:03,995 --> 01:39:06,079
Reports say it's SOL.

1118
01:39:17,008 --> 01:39:18,925
Magnificent.

1119
01:39:29,061 --> 01:39:31,104
When Tetsuo's power
reaches its peak...

1120
01:39:31,230 --> 01:39:33,106
is that what you're thinking?

1121
01:39:33,232 --> 01:39:37,402
That's when we do it.
But will it really work?

1122
01:39:38,237 --> 01:39:43,283
We know the future doesn't necessarily proceed
along a single course.

1123
01:39:43,409 --> 01:39:46,870
There ought to be a future we can choose.
It's up to us to find it.

1124
01:39:57,089 --> 01:39:58,924
- What's Tetsuo's status, doctor?

1125
01:39:58,925 --> 01:40:00,383
- What's Tetsuo's status, doctor?
- Colonel.

1126
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:03,637
We set up a camera in the
stadium if you want to check.

1127
01:40:04,013 --> 01:40:06,223
We have him under observation.

1128
01:40:07,517 --> 01:40:11,478
Colonel, you must take a look at this data.
It's phenomenal!

1129
01:40:11,604 --> 01:40:15,315
We're still analyzing the energy
given off by the subject, but it's just magnificent.

1130
01:40:15,441 --> 01:40:17,317
Oh, yes, wonderful.

1131
01:40:17,443 --> 01:40:20,153
Of course, this is clearly
a proton collapse.

1132
01:40:20,279 --> 01:40:24,825
We're also detecting a fair number of what
we believe to be unknown particles to science.

1133
01:40:24,951 --> 01:40:27,285
If we can put this into
a theoretical framework...

1134
01:40:27,411 --> 01:40:29,454
then physics...
quantum physics...

1135
01:40:29,580 --> 01:40:32,499
humanity itself could know
the fundamental truths.

1136
01:40:34,961 --> 01:40:37,254
Uh... Uh... Well, you see...

1137
01:40:37,296 --> 01:40:39,256
we still haven't finished
making our adjustments.

1138
01:40:39,423 --> 01:40:41,091
Wait, Colonel.

1139
01:40:46,556 --> 01:40:48,515
What the... The pattern!

1140
01:40:51,018 --> 01:40:54,187
You bastard!
What did I tell you?

1141
01:40:54,313 --> 01:40:56,189
But, Colonel...

1142
01:40:56,315 --> 01:40:58,692
I couldn't throw away
such a magnificent subject.

1143
01:40:59,986 --> 01:41:00,861
Shut up!

1144
01:41:23,801 --> 01:41:25,844
Oh! Oh, oh! Oh, shit!

1145
01:41:25,845 --> 01:41:27,554
Quick! The battery!

1146
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:30,724
Come on!
My bike's burning up!

1147
01:41:30,808 --> 01:41:33,310
Hey, what's losing
a bike or two, huh?

1148
01:41:33,436 --> 01:41:36,479
What? Then there's nothing wrong
with using yours, right?

1149
01:41:36,606 --> 01:41:38,356
- I said that out loud, did I?

1150
01:41:38,357 --> 01:41:39,482
- I said that out loud, did I?
- Yeah, you did.

1151
01:41:39,609 --> 01:41:41,526
By the way,
your bike's still on fire.

1152
01:41:41,652 --> 01:41:43,069
Huh? Oh, man! Oh!

1153
01:42:23,527 --> 01:42:25,612
Tetsuo?

1154
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:40,710
Tetsuo, why is everyone calling you Akira?
What does it mean?

1155
01:42:40,836 --> 01:42:42,754
It means nothing.

1156
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:44,589
He never existed.

1157
01:42:45,591 --> 01:42:47,467
It doesn't matter who he is.
They don't care.

1158
01:42:50,262 --> 01:42:52,263
Just so long as he destroys things.

1159
01:42:53,432 --> 01:42:55,558
What's that?
Your arm! Look at it!

1160
01:42:55,935 --> 01:42:59,312
Well, it doesn't look like much,
but it still works pretty good.

1161
01:43:02,608 --> 01:43:04,985
What's wrong? Are you okay?

1162
01:43:07,446 --> 01:43:08,613
It's nothing!

1163
01:43:09,365 --> 01:43:10,198
- Tetsuo, I just......

1164
01:43:10,199 --> 01:43:12,575
- Tetsuo, I just......
- Shut up! Just go away!

1165
01:43:19,709 --> 01:43:21,084
Medicine.

1166
01:43:21,752 --> 01:43:25,130
What's wrong, Tetsuo?
Are you in pain? Huh?

1167
01:43:25,256 --> 01:43:28,508
Go back to the lab
and get that medicine.

1168
01:43:28,634 --> 01:43:30,802
Doctor, did you hear that?

1169
01:43:30,928 --> 01:43:32,387
- I did, Colonel.

1170
01:43:32,388 --> 01:43:34,347
- I did, Colonel.
-Well, any signs of it?

1171
01:43:34,807 --> 01:43:36,683
I can't be entirely certain here...

1172
01:43:36,892 --> 01:43:41,521
but it seems that the power which had been
held back by the drugs is breaking free.

1173
01:43:41,647 --> 01:43:45,191
He may not be able to control the power
that has awakened so suddenly!

1174
01:43:45,317 --> 01:43:47,861
He's in an extremely
critical condition!

1175
01:43:48,821 --> 01:43:51,781
Come back to the lab and
receive proper treatment.

1176
01:43:51,824 --> 01:43:53,700
If you don't, you may die.

1177
01:43:55,911 --> 01:44:00,040
You want me to enroll in your kindergarten
and live happily ever after, huh?

1178
01:44:00,166 --> 01:44:02,042
Be quiet
and do what you're told.

1179
01:44:02,168 --> 01:44:05,837
Take your medicine every day
and end up all shriveled like those kids!

1180
01:44:10,843 --> 01:44:14,054
Kaori.

1181
01:44:17,266 --> 01:44:19,017
Fetch medicine, please.

1182
01:44:19,143 --> 01:44:20,310
No.

1183
01:44:20,978 --> 01:44:22,020
Stop, Tetsuo!

1184
01:44:23,981 --> 01:44:25,231
Tetsuo!

1185
01:44:27,026 --> 01:44:28,359
No, Tetsu...!

1186
01:45:00,142 --> 01:45:01,267
Kaneda!

1187
01:45:39,765 --> 01:45:40,640
Huh?

1188
01:45:48,691 --> 01:45:51,067
Son of a... Huh?

1189
01:45:53,946 --> 01:45:56,114
What are you three...doing here?

1190
01:46:02,121 --> 01:46:04,330
You didn't learn
your lesson, did you?

1191
01:46:06,625 --> 01:46:07,959
Heads up, Tetsuo!

1192
01:46:22,141 --> 01:46:23,766
Takashi.

1193
01:46:26,478 --> 01:46:28,271
Akira's here.

1194
01:46:41,452 --> 01:46:45,205
Help, Kaneda! Help, please!

1195
01:46:54,506 --> 01:46:57,175
Kaori!

1196
01:46:59,511 --> 01:47:02,222
Please, help me!

1197
01:47:14,109 --> 01:47:15,985
Help me!

1198
01:47:16,195 --> 01:47:18,029
Let her go!

1199
01:47:35,005 --> 01:47:38,925
Kaori. Kaori. Kaori!

1200
01:47:39,051 --> 01:47:41,678
Tetsuo, are you there?

1201
01:47:41,804 --> 01:47:44,889
Kaori!
Kaori's gonna die!

1202
01:47:45,015 --> 01:47:47,517
What? What did you say?

1203
01:47:47,643 --> 01:47:51,437
My body's not doing
what I tell it to.

1204
01:47:51,563 --> 01:47:55,358
My power's acting
on its own. Kaori!

1205
01:47:55,526 --> 01:47:57,443
Kaori's dying.

1206
01:47:57,653 --> 01:48:00,238
Kaneda, help me!

1207
01:48:00,364 --> 01:48:04,367
Stop this, Tetsuo!
Stop it now!

1208
01:48:04,493 --> 01:48:08,121
Kaori's pain is coming into me.

1209
01:48:09,748 --> 01:48:11,541
Tetsuo!

1210
01:48:12,710 --> 01:48:16,296
Kaneda, run away!

1211
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:31,436
Tetsuo!

1212
01:48:43,115 --> 01:48:47,076
Kiyoko, Takashi, Masaru!
Hurry! Get away from here!

1213
01:48:51,123 --> 01:48:52,582
Come on!

1214
01:48:58,630 --> 01:49:02,008
I can't believe it. It's as if......

1215
01:49:14,438 --> 01:49:17,357
Kiyoko! Taka......

1216
01:49:51,350 --> 01:49:52,392
Hi.

1217
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:55,895
Akira.

1218
01:50:04,113 --> 01:50:06,030
Oh, no! That's the......

1219
01:50:07,449 --> 01:50:09,534
But that's impossible!

1220
01:50:19,294 --> 01:50:21,671
Where am I?

1221
01:50:21,797 --> 01:50:25,550
Hurry. Get into the tunnel.
You'll be safe in there.

1222
01:50:25,634 --> 01:50:27,677
Kiyoko, where are you?

1223
01:50:29,346 --> 01:50:30,930
Oh......

1224
01:50:42,234 --> 01:50:43,943
Tetsuo!

1225
01:50:44,069 --> 01:50:46,446
Kaneda!

1226
01:50:46,697 --> 01:50:48,114
Hang on!

1227
01:50:50,325 --> 01:50:51,534
- Hurry! You've got to get out of here!

1228
01:50:51,535 --> 01:50:52,952
- Hurry! You've got to get out of here!
- Out of the way!

1229
01:50:53,078 --> 01:50:54,495
- Tetsuo!

1230
01:50:54,496 --> 01:50:56,080
- Tetsuo!
- Don't go near it!

1231
01:51:02,671 --> 01:51:05,298
No, don't! Wait, Takashi!

1232
01:51:05,424 --> 01:51:08,801
If you went in now, you'd
be trapped along with him.

1233
01:51:08,927 --> 01:51:12,805
But he... None of this
is his fault at all.

1234
01:51:20,105 --> 01:51:21,272
- Takashi!

1235
01:51:21,273 --> 01:51:22,815
- Takashi!
- Takashi!

1236
01:51:29,072 --> 01:51:31,824
If we went in there...

1237
01:51:31,950 --> 01:51:35,244
we wouldn't be strong enough
to come back out again.

1238
01:51:36,455 --> 01:51:38,789
But if the three of us tried...

1239
01:51:38,916 --> 01:51:40,791
maybe we could save that boy.

1240
01:51:40,918 --> 01:51:44,003
You're right.
Us three together.

1241
01:51:53,138 --> 01:51:57,350
Look at that. We should get
out of here now! Hey!

1242
01:51:58,435 --> 01:52:00,353
Kaneda's in there.

1243
01:52:33,136 --> 01:52:36,847
You see that? You're not revving
your engine enough already.

1244
01:52:36,974 --> 01:52:40,560
When you go into a corner,
lean in suicidally. Got it? Now watch.

1245
01:52:40,644 --> 01:52:42,353
- What the hell do you call that?

1246
01:52:42,354 --> 01:52:44,021
- What the hell do you call that?
- Cornering, man.

1247
01:52:45,607 --> 01:52:47,567
You got it, Tetsuo?

1248
01:52:53,907 --> 01:52:56,659
Hey, look! They brought another kid!
Is he a transfer student?

1249
01:52:56,702 --> 01:52:58,035
- His mom and dad left him.

1250
01:52:58,036 --> 01:53:00,496
- His mom and dad left him.
- You can see it in his face.

1251
01:53:03,709 --> 01:53:08,504
Are these... Are these all of your dreams
and memories, Tetsuo?

1252
01:53:10,007 --> 01:53:11,924
Uh, wait.

1253
01:54:29,211 --> 01:54:31,671
Is this Akira?

1254
01:54:31,963 --> 01:54:35,424
Yes. We called
him here to the three of us.

1255
01:54:35,550 --> 01:54:38,010
He's going to take
Tetsuo with him.

1256
01:54:38,095 --> 01:54:41,013
Take him where?
Where?

1257
01:54:41,223 --> 01:54:43,349
It's too much for Tetsuo...

1258
01:54:43,475 --> 01:54:47,186
and for the three of us also
and for Akira too.

1259
01:54:47,312 --> 01:54:50,856
It's way too big
for us, as we are now.

1260
01:54:50,982 --> 01:54:54,694
But someday we ought
to be able to......

1261
01:54:54,820 --> 01:54:58,155
Because it has already begun.

1262
01:54:58,281 --> 01:55:00,700
Your friend, she's......

1263
01:55:00,826 --> 01:55:02,368
My friend?

1264
01:55:03,286 --> 01:55:06,205
Kei! It's Kei
you're talking about!

1265
01:55:31,857 --> 01:55:33,733
Tetsuo.

1266
01:55:38,113 --> 01:55:40,030
This is yours, right?

1267
01:55:45,871 --> 01:55:48,748
They're always like that
with the new kids.

1268
01:55:48,874 --> 01:55:50,249
Hey, you came today, right?

1269
01:55:50,375 --> 01:55:54,754
They beat me up too, but the truth is,
those guys are wimps.

1270
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:58,090
My name is... Tetsuo.

1271
01:55:58,216 --> 01:55:59,592
Tetsuo Shima.

1272
01:56:01,344 --> 01:56:04,346
The truth is,
I just got here myself.

1273
01:56:04,473 --> 01:56:06,182
My name is......

1274
01:56:06,558 --> 01:56:10,770
Kaneda. Kaneda.

1275
01:56:11,229 --> 01:56:12,229
- Kaneda!

1276
01:56:12,230 --> 01:56:12,938
- Kaneda!
- Kei.

1277
01:56:39,591 --> 01:56:42,134
What in the world is happening?
What's this?

1278
01:56:45,514 --> 01:56:47,640
No, this isn't......

1279
01:56:47,766 --> 01:56:51,811
If this is correct, it's showing that this is
the birth of the universe.

1280
01:56:58,443 --> 01:57:01,570
Kei!

1281
01:57:06,952 --> 01:57:08,994
What's going on here?

1282
01:57:11,122 --> 01:57:12,957
Disappearing.
It's disappearing.

1283
01:58:24,279 --> 01:58:26,530
Kaneda, can you hear me?

1284
01:58:49,888 --> 01:58:51,263
Tetsuo.

1285
01:58:54,351 --> 01:58:56,602
Kaneda, what is it?

1286
01:58:57,228 --> 01:58:58,354
Thank you.

1287
01:58:58,813 --> 01:58:59,772
Huh?

1288
01:59:00,190 --> 01:59:03,108
You called me, didn't you,
and I heard you.

1289
01:59:10,408 --> 01:59:12,785
Kaneda! Oh, my!

1290
01:59:13,495 --> 01:59:15,037
Where's Tetsuo?

1291
01:59:16,247 --> 01:59:17,706
He just left.

1292
01:59:18,750 --> 01:59:21,794
Those kids did too.
Akira also.

1293
01:59:22,253 --> 01:59:24,922
Kaneda, back then...
Oh, did you just...

1294
01:59:26,508 --> 01:59:28,384
Kaneda!

1295
01:59:28,510 --> 01:59:31,053
You're alive!

1296
01:59:31,179 --> 01:59:33,305
I thought...

1297
01:59:33,556 --> 01:59:35,933
I thought you were
in there for sure.

1298
01:59:38,770 --> 01:59:41,105
Tetsuo!
What happened to Tetsuo?

1299
01:59:41,773 --> 01:59:43,107
Is he dead?

1300
01:59:43,233 --> 01:59:44,817
I'm not sure.

1301
01:59:45,402 --> 01:59:47,403
Something... Oh!

1302
02:00:12,637 --> 02:00:16,181
But someday we
ought to be able to......

1303
02:00:16,307 --> 02:00:19,685
Because it has already begun.
