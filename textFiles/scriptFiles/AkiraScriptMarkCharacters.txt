<p>AKIRA (1988)</p>

<p>1
00:01:58,050 --&gt; 00:02:02,929
Groups of unemployed workers,
who have grown in number...</p>

<p>2
00:02:03,055 --&gt; 00:02:07,683
due to tax reforms enacted by the former
Prime Minister, are rioting all across the country.</p>

<p>3
00:02:07,809 --&gt; 00:02:10,061
There is confusion among parliament members
which was sparked by the comments...</p>

<p>4
00:02:10,187 --&gt; 00:02:13,564
of Finance Minister Takanashi
during the recent parliament inquiry.</p>

<p>5
00:02:13,690 --&gt; 00:02:16,609
There seems to be no compromise in sight
between the government and opposition.</p>

<p>6
00:02:16,735 --&gt; 00:02:18,861
- Hey, there. Call it.</p>

<p>7
00:02:18,862 --&gt; 00:02:21,280
- Hey, there. Call it.
- Gimme somethin'. Three peanuts.</p>

<p>8
00:02:22,407 --&gt; 00:02:24,033
Let's see......</p>

<p>9
00:02:25,369 --&gt; 00:02:26,452
Now, uh......</p>

<p>10
00:02:38,924 --&gt; 00:02:41,467
The Clown bastards are herded
out on route number 5.</p>

<p>11
00:02:44,429 --&gt; 00:02:47,139
Damn it, don't scare me like that.
Open that damn door quietly.</p>

<p>12
00:02:47,265 --&gt; 00:02:50,393
You know, you wouldn't be so jumpy
if you didn't have anything to hide.</p>

<p>13
00:02:53,021 --&gt; 00:02:54,647
Why don't you sell
normal drinks for a change?</p>

<p>14
00:02:54,940 --&gt; 00:02:58,734
How about buyin' somethin' for once?
This ain't a hangout for damn street gangs.</p>

<p>15
00:02:58,860 --&gt; 00:03:00,653
Yeah, right!
Drink your dog piss?</p>

<p>16
00:03:05,075 --&gt; 00:03:07,994
Twin ceramic rotor drives
on each wheel.</p>

<p>17
00:03:08,078 --&gt; 00:03:10,287
Let's see. And these are...</p>

<p>18
00:03:10,372 --&gt; 00:03:14,625
computer-controlled
antilock brakes.</p>

<p>19
00:03:14,751 --&gt; 00:03:17,336
Huh, 200 horses at 12,000 R.P.M.</p>

<p>20
00:03:20,298 --&gt; 00:03:22,675
You want to ride it, Tetsuo?</p>

<p>21
00:03:22,801 --&gt; 00:03:24,010
All right! Let's hit it!</p>

<p>22
00:03:26,930 --&gt; 00:03:30,266
I customized that bike for myself.
It's too wild. You couldn't handle it.</p>

<p>23
00:03:31,476 --&gt; 00:03:34,520
I don't see how you could ride
something crazy like that, man.</p>

<p>24
00:03:36,314 --&gt; 00:03:37,273
Huh! I could.</p>

<p>25
00:03:37,482 --&gt; 00:03:40,526
Ha! If you want it so bad
then steal one yourself.</p>

<p>26
00:04:47,135 --&gt; 00:04:48,052
- Unbelievable.</p>

<p>27
00:04:48,053 --&gt; 00:04:49,053
- Unbelievable.
- Punks!</p>

<p>28
00:04:51,890 --&gt; 00:04:53,432
Hey, waiter!
Where are you going?</p>

<p>29
00:04:57,062 --&gt; 00:04:59,939
They ran into the alley!
After 'em!</p>

<p>30
00:05:13,245 --&gt; 00:05:15,955
Quit foolin' around, you idiot!</p>

<p>31
00:05:19,417 --&gt; 00:05:20,417
Fuck!</p>

<p>32
00:05:53,368 --&gt; 00:05:54,410
What?</p>

<p>33
00:06:24,482 --&gt; 00:06:25,649
- That's the......</p>

<p>34
00:06:25,650 --&gt; 00:06:26,275
- That's the......
- Huh?</p>

<p>35
00:06:26,401 --&gt; 00:06:28,194
This is unit 375.</p>

<p>36
00:06:28,320 --&gt; 00:06:33,365
We've got reports of biker gangs fighting
near the intersection of highway 14 South.</p>

<p>37
00:06:33,491 --&gt; 00:06:36,285
Request immediate assistance.
Car 375 en route to the scene......</p>

<p>38
00:06:37,996 --&gt; 00:06:39,455
It's the cops.
What should we do?</p>

<p>39
00:06:39,748 --&gt; 00:06:42,499
Damn it. My motor coils were
just getting warmed up.</p>

<p>40
00:06:48,673 --&gt; 00:06:51,884
Bastards!
Let's go, Tetsuo!</p>

<p>41
00:06:52,010 --&gt; 00:06:53,302
I'm coming!</p>

<p>42
00:06:53,428 --&gt; 00:06:54,303
- Damn them!</p>

<p>43
00:06:54,304 --&gt; 00:06:55,221
- Damn them!
- Come on!</p>

<p>44
00:07:04,272 --&gt; 00:07:07,650
A skirmish has broken out between student
protesters and riot police.</p>

<p>45
00:07:07,776 --&gt; 00:07:10,736
There appear to be some
casualties. Next...</p>

<p>46
00:07:32,217 --&gt; 00:07:34,343
Don't make me get out of this car!</p>

<p>47
00:07:34,469 --&gt; 00:07:36,553
Jerk, I'm in a hurry!</p>

<p>48
00:07:51,695 --&gt; 00:07:53,737
- What was that?</p>

<p>49
00:07:53,738 --&gt; 00:07:55,114
- What was that?
- Police is here!!</p>

<p>50
00:08:21,224 --&gt; 00:08:24,727
This area is off limits!</p>

<p>51
00:08:24,978 --&gt; 00:08:27,313
Go back! It's dangerous!</p>

<p>52
00:08:27,397 --&gt; 00:08:28,647
Hey, something strange
over there.</p>

<p>53
00:08:28,773 --&gt; 00:08:30,316
Let me through!
Sorry.</p>

<p>54
00:08:30,442 --&gt; 00:08:31,150
What're you doing?</p>

<p>55
00:08:39,617 --&gt; 00:08:41,744
It's blood. Look!</p>

<p>56
00:08:42,203 --&gt; 00:08:45,456
Please let me through.
Excuse me. Pardon me.</p>

<p>57
00:08:45,582 --&gt; 00:08:47,249
Watch it, jerk!</p>

<p>58
00:08:50,962 --&gt; 00:08:53,005
Pardon me. I'm sorry.</p>

<p>59
00:08:53,548 --&gt; 00:08:54,340
Ryu!</p>

<p>60
00:08:54,716 --&gt; 00:08:57,384
Hey, look!
They're running away!</p>

<p>61
00:09:02,223 --&gt; 00:09:03,849
He's got a gun!</p>

<p>62
00:09:09,814 --&gt; 00:09:11,690
Fire!</p>

<p>63
00:09:13,318 --&gt; 00:09:15,194
Wait! He's got a kid!</p>

<p>64
00:09:25,789 --&gt; 00:09:26,705
Run.</p>

<p>65
00:09:27,957 --&gt; 00:09:29,833
You gotta hurry.</p>

<p>66
00:09:33,671 --&gt; 00:09:36,048
Go to Ryu.</p>

<p>67
00:09:36,174 --&gt; 00:09:39,051
Ryu will help you now.</p>

<p>68
00:09:42,931 --&gt; 00:09:45,057
Get out of here... Now!</p>

<p>69
00:10:17,549 --&gt; 00:10:19,508
Kei!</p>

<p>70
00:10:21,219 --&gt; 00:10:23,762
We've gotta get out of here, Kei?</p>

<p>71
00:10:27,058 --&gt; 00:10:28,767
He's gone!</p>

<p>72
00:10:37,569 --&gt; 00:10:39,194
He's to the West.</p>

<p>73
00:10:40,572 --&gt; 00:10:43,198
West?
The old city......</p>

<p>74
00:10:54,586 --&gt; 00:10:55,627
Eat this!</p>

<p>75
00:11:08,266 --&gt; 00:11:09,933
Tetsuo!</p>

<p>76
00:11:48,806 --&gt; 00:11:51,683
Ryu! Where are you?</p>

<p>77
00:11:55,396 --&gt; 00:11:56,271
Kei!</p>

<p>78
00:12:23,258 --&gt; 00:12:24,800
No, that's......</p>

<p>79
00:12:45,029 --&gt; 00:12:46,572
How do you like that?</p>

<p>80
00:12:56,624 --&gt; 00:12:58,750
Well? Who is it?</p>

<p>81
00:12:58,876 --&gt; 00:13:01,253
It's not him.
It's not Tetsuo.</p>

<p>82
00:13:01,379 --&gt; 00:13:03,255
All right. Move out!</p>

<p>83
00:13:08,136 --&gt; 00:13:13,098
Why you... What'd you do,
you weird little......</p>

<p>84
00:13:26,029 --&gt; 00:13:28,864
Tetsuo! Just hang on!</p>

<p>85
00:13:31,409 --&gt; 00:13:32,576
What? What did you say?</p>

<p>86
00:13:32,702 --&gt; 00:13:34,911
That kid......</p>

<p>87
00:13:37,206 --&gt; 00:13:39,875
He's really hurt bad.</p>

<p>88
00:13:40,501 --&gt; 00:13:42,628
Hey! You, there!</p>

<p>89
00:13:43,379 --&gt; 00:13:46,882
We gotta get him to a hospital!
He needs an ambulance!</p>

<p>90
00:13:46,924 --&gt; 00:13:48,884
We can't move him!</p>

<p>91
00:13:57,518 --&gt; 00:13:59,811
Wha...What the...!</p>

<p>92
00:14:14,702 --&gt; 00:14:16,953
There's no escape.</p>

<p>93
00:14:22,377 --&gt; 00:14:24,503
We're here to take you
back with us.</p>

<p>94
00:14:29,967 --&gt; 00:14:33,512
You know we can't survive outside.</p>

<p>95
00:14:33,638 --&gt; 00:14:35,180
Well, come along.</p>

<p>96
00:14:38,309 --&gt; 00:14:41,353
Army helicopters!
It's the army!</p>

<p>97
00:14:48,152 --&gt; 00:14:49,528
Move out!</p>

<p>98
00:15:00,415 --&gt; 00:15:02,124
Kiss the ground!
Hands on your heads!</p>

<p>99
00:15:02,500 --&gt; 00:15:05,460
We're, uh, innocent bystanders,
that's all.</p>

<p>100
00:15:05,586 --&gt; 00:15:07,879
Kiss the ground!
Hands on your heads!</p>

<p>101
00:15:17,014 --&gt; 00:15:19,391
That hurts, damn it.</p>

<p>102
00:15:19,517 --&gt; 00:15:20,392
Kai!</p>

<p>103
00:15:26,149 --&gt; 00:15:27,524
Soldier.</p>

<p>104
00:15:27,525 --&gt; 00:15:28,358
- Sir.</p>

<p>105
00:15:28,359 --&gt; 00:15:29,693
- Sir.
- Who are those kids?</p>

<p>106
00:15:29,777 --&gt; 00:15:32,195
They seem to be
an ordinary biker gang, sir.</p>

<p>107
00:15:47,336 --&gt; 00:15:50,005
We're returning.</p>

<p>108
00:15:50,131 --&gt; 00:15:52,215
- Ouch! Will you just hold on a minute?</p>

<p>109
00:15:52,216 --&gt; 00:15:54,509
- Ouch! Will you just hold on a minute?
- My arms don't bend that way!</p>

<p>110
00:15:54,635 --&gt; 00:15:57,429
Pull the wounded
onto the helicopter.</p>

<p>111
00:15:57,555 --&gt; 00:16:01,349
Tetsuo! Hey, wait! You can't
take him away like that!</p>

<p>112
00:16:01,476 --&gt; 00:16:02,517
Kaneda!</p>

<p>113
00:16:02,977 --&gt; 00:16:05,854
What the hell are you guys doing?
We didn't do anything!</p>

<p>114
00:16:05,980 --&gt; 00:16:07,355
Get off!</p>

<p>115
00:17:07,542 --&gt; 00:17:12,003
All right. The story is, you and your
friends went out at night...</p>

<p>116
00:17:12,129 --&gt; 00:17:14,422
on your bikes to visit
your dying mother, and then...</p>

<p>117
00:17:14,549 --&gt; 00:17:18,343
another bunch of biker hooligans
called the Clowns attacked you.</p>

<p>118
00:17:18,636 --&gt; 00:17:21,805
They hurt your friend, you lost your temper,
and that's why eight of these Clowns...</p>

<p>119
00:17:21,931 --&gt; 00:17:25,517
your attackers...are all now in the hospital,
and that is the truth.</p>

<p>120
00:17:25,643 --&gt; 00:17:27,811
Wow! She sure is hot.</p>

<p>121
00:17:28,312 --&gt; 00:17:30,605
Hmm? This is confidential!</p>

<p>122
00:17:31,148 --&gt; 00:17:32,315
And how's your mother doing?</p>

<p>123
00:17:32,483 --&gt; 00:17:36,528
Fortunately, the worst is over.
She cleared the hump.</p>

<p>124
00:17:36,654 --&gt; 00:17:39,781
She cleared the hump,
and you left her for cruising, huh?</p>

<p>125
00:17:39,907 --&gt; 00:17:41,032
Wha...?</p>

<p>126
00:17:45,413 --&gt; 00:17:47,622
Ah, these bozos couldn't
have anything to do with it.</p>

<p>127
00:17:47,748 --&gt; 00:17:49,624
That goes without saying.</p>

<p>128
00:17:50,960 --&gt; 00:17:54,379
Wait out on that bench.
Do you understand?</p>

<p>129
00:17:57,008 --&gt; 00:17:59,467
All right.
Send in the next five.</p>

<p>130
00:18:01,262 --&gt; 00:18:03,471
So the army's working
with the police...</p>

<p>131
00:18:03,598 --&gt; 00:18:06,558
to hunt down antigovernment
groups, or so it seems.</p>

<p>132
00:18:13,190 --&gt; 00:18:14,190
- You wanna put up a fight?</p>

<p>133
00:18:14,191 --&gt; 00:18:15,358
- You wanna put up a fight?
- Get your hands off me!</p>

<p>134
00:18:22,033 --&gt; 00:18:24,743
Long live
the freedom revolution!</p>

<p>135
00:18:27,163 --&gt; 00:18:29,497
He's got a grenade!</p>

<p>136
00:18:44,388 --&gt; 00:18:47,766
All right, that's enough.
Get him back in there.</p>

<p>137
00:18:47,892 --&gt; 00:18:50,268
I'll teach him a lesson.
He won't forget.</p>

<p>138
00:18:50,394 --&gt; 00:18:53,772
You dumb bastard!
If you wanna die, hang yourself!</p>

<p>139
00:18:54,398 --&gt; 00:18:58,276
Listen, you kids are free to leave.
We've contacted your schools.</p>

<p>140
00:19:00,404 --&gt; 00:19:01,613
Hold on a second, old man!</p>

<p>141
00:19:02,907 --&gt; 00:19:04,366
Wha... "Old man"?</p>

<p>142
00:19:04,492 --&gt; 00:19:05,951
There was someone else with us, you know.</p>

<p>143
00:19:06,369 --&gt; 00:19:07,452
What was that?</p>

<p>144
00:19:07,578 --&gt; 00:19:10,246
Excuse me, please?</p>

<p>145
00:19:10,373 --&gt; 00:19:13,083
Huh? Hey!
What are you doing?</p>

<p>146
00:19:13,209 --&gt; 00:19:16,086
Uh, it's this one right here.
Can't leave my friend.</p>

<p>147
00:19:16,212 --&gt; 00:19:18,713
Don't ever call me "old man,"
you little punk!</p>

<p>148
00:19:19,256 --&gt; 00:19:20,465
That's my foot !</p>

<p>149
00:19:20,591 --&gt; 00:19:25,303
You listen here, kid. I'm only 25 years old.
I'm not even married yet.</p>

<p>150
00:19:25,429 --&gt; 00:19:29,641
Watch your mouth.
Get out of here and take your friend with you.</p>

<p>151
00:19:29,767 --&gt; 00:19:30,600
- I'm starving!</p>

<p>152
00:19:30,601 --&gt; 00:19:32,310
- I'm starving!
- I need a doctor!</p>

<p>153
00:19:32,436 --&gt; 00:19:37,607
I think the army was chasing that weird kid
Kaneda saw. That's what I think.</p>

<p>154
00:19:37,733 --&gt; 00:19:40,276
Yeah, you're right.
I think I saw him too.</p>

<p>155
00:19:40,403 --&gt; 00:19:44,155
Speaking of Tetsuo, why the hell wouldn't they
tell us what hospital they threw him in?</p>

<p>156
00:19:44,448 --&gt; 00:19:45,615
Huh? What was that?</p>

<p>157
00:19:46,075 --&gt; 00:19:49,411
What I meant was
maybe we could go for a drink.</p>

<p>158
00:19:49,537 --&gt; 00:19:52,747
I figure we could have a nice,
long chat about something you're into...</p>

<p>159
00:19:52,873 --&gt; 00:19:55,000
like the whole revolution thing.</p>

<p>160
00:19:56,127 --&gt; 00:19:58,670
I think you're a skirt chaser
who'll try anything he can.</p>

<p>161
00:19:59,255 --&gt; 00:20:02,007
You'll help anyone so long as
it's a girl. Right?</p>

<p>162
00:20:02,133 --&gt; 00:20:03,174
You're wrong!</p>

<p>163
00:20:03,300 --&gt; 00:20:03,967
- I have very high standards.</p>

<p>164
00:20:03,968 --&gt; 00:20:06,928
- I have very high standards.
- Line 'em up! Come on! Move it!</p>

<p>165
00:20:07,054 --&gt; 00:20:09,431
It's not their looks that count.
It's their... I don't know......</p>

<p>166
00:20:09,557 --&gt; 00:20:12,183
A girl's sensitivity
that makes me do it.</p>

<p>167
00:20:12,309 --&gt; 00:20:16,187
I suppose I owe you one.
Thank you very much, uh......</p>

<p>168
00:20:16,313 --&gt; 00:20:17,814
- I'm Kaneda. It's nice to... Huh?</p>

<p>169
00:20:17,815 --&gt; 00:20:19,190
- I'm Kaneda. It's nice to... Huh?
- See you around, Kaneda.</p>

<p>170
00:20:19,817 --&gt; 00:20:23,486
Wait a second!
You're leaving just like that?</p>

<p>171
00:20:23,612 --&gt; 00:20:27,866
Hey! Now hold on. I'm the guy
that saved you back there.</p>

<p>172
00:20:31,328 --&gt; 00:20:34,789
You could at least tell me
your name, you cold bitch!</p>

<p>173
00:20:36,834 --&gt; 00:20:41,212
Yes, I'll try talking with him,
but it's risky business.</p>

<p>174
00:20:41,338 --&gt; 00:20:45,216
If they think you're avoiding responsibility,
the whole thing could blow up in your face.</p>

<p>175
00:20:46,761 --&gt; 00:20:49,971
I can't believe that there's
a mole in the executive council.</p>

<p>176
00:20:50,639 --&gt; 00:20:51,890
Even if there is a mole......</p>

<p>177
00:20:52,349 --&gt; 00:20:54,392
That's not what's important here!</p>

<p>178
00:20:54,518 --&gt; 00:20:58,730
What is are political maneuvers
and diplomacy which, apparently, you despise.</p>

<p>179
00:20:58,856 --&gt; 00:21:01,232
I never studied the two subjects
in school, it would seem.</p>

<p>180
00:21:01,358 --&gt; 00:21:04,235
In any case, at the next
executive council meeting...</p>

<p>181
00:21:04,361 --&gt; 00:21:06,988
your poor management and lack of
judgment on this last incident...</p>

<p>182
00:21:07,198 --&gt; 00:21:09,407
will be called into question.</p>

<p>183
00:21:13,204 --&gt; 00:21:14,746
There's a call for the colonel, sir.</p>

<p>184
00:21:17,500 --&gt; 00:21:20,251
Put your affairs in order,
if you want my advice.</p>

<p>185
00:21:23,214 --&gt; 00:21:25,090
Yes, it's me. What is it now?</p>

<p>186
00:21:46,028 --&gt; 00:21:48,571
This way, please, Colonel.</p>

<p>187
00:21:48,697 --&gt; 00:21:53,743
I'm terribly sorry to call you here,
but there's something you really must see.</p>

<p>188
00:21:57,581 --&gt; 00:21:59,457
Colonel, please look at this.</p>

<p>189
00:21:59,917 --&gt; 00:22:02,418
It's the special pattern
I'm getting from that young man.</p>

<p>190
00:22:02,545 --&gt; 00:22:04,963
It doesn't resemble any
that I've seen so far...</p>

<p>191
00:22:05,089 --&gt; 00:22:08,216
and I've never seen a developmental speed
or configuration like this.</p>

<p>192
00:22:08,342 --&gt; 00:22:12,720
It may have begun with the shock of contact with
number 26, or it could be......</p>

<p>193
00:22:12,847 --&gt; 00:22:15,807
Have you finished running the comparison
against Akira's pattern?</p>

<p>194
00:22:15,933 --&gt; 00:22:18,393
I'll show you right now.</p>

<p>195
00:22:22,022 --&gt; 00:22:25,650
This projection is made using
mixed data, and the results are not quite correct...</p>

<p>196
00:22:25,776 --&gt; 00:22:28,319
so a direct comparison is difficult.</p>

<p>197
00:22:28,445 --&gt; 00:22:31,906
But I believe based on what we see here that
this boy's pattern is the key...</p>

<p>198
00:22:32,032 --&gt; 00:22:35,285
to solving the riddle of
Akira's growth-pattern process.</p>

<p>199
00:22:35,411 --&gt; 00:22:37,036
- Fine. You may continue.</p>

<p>200
00:22:37,037 --&gt; 00:22:38,663
- Fine. You may continue.
- Thank you very much, sir.</p>

<p>201
00:22:38,789 --&gt; 00:22:42,167
I'm certain he'll turn out to be a worthy addition
to the numbers, don't you?</p>

<p>202
00:22:42,293 --&gt; 00:22:45,170
It may be rough on the boy...</p>

<p>203
00:22:45,296 --&gt; 00:22:48,756
but I thought we might try starting him off with
level 7 capsules.</p>

<p>204
00:22:48,883 --&gt; 00:22:50,341
Is it safe, doctor?</p>

<p>205
00:22:50,467 --&gt; 00:22:51,676
I will take care of it.</p>

<p>206
00:22:51,802 --&gt; 00:22:56,181
No! I wasn't talking
about the boy at all!</p>

<p>207
00:22:56,307 --&gt; 00:22:59,309
If he turns out
to reach a power like Akira's...</p>

<p>208
00:22:59,435 --&gt; 00:23:02,020
are you positive that you are
able to control such power?</p>

<p>209
00:23:02,146 --&gt; 00:23:03,813
Uh, well, that's a......</p>

<p>210
00:23:04,815 --&gt; 00:23:06,691
Can you handle this?</p>

<p>211
00:23:06,817 --&gt; 00:23:09,194
Uh, well, then, in my opinion...</p>

<p>212
00:23:09,320 --&gt; 00:23:12,947
if we can use the latest examination equipment
to collect even more data...</p>

<p>213
00:23:13,073 --&gt; 00:23:16,534
and also do a multifaceted
analysis as we go, then surely......</p>

<p>214
00:23:17,953 --&gt; 00:23:22,040
But maybe we weren't meant to
meddle with that ultimate power.</p>

<p>215
00:23:22,499 --&gt; 00:23:25,460
You mean...
the power of a god?</p>

<p>216
00:23:28,172 --&gt; 00:23:30,840
"A-ki-ra."</p>

<p>217
00:23:30,966 --&gt; 00:23:33,343
But we have no choice
but to grasp that power...</p>

<p>218
00:23:33,510 --&gt; 00:23:36,846
grasp that power
and learn to control it.</p>

<p>219
00:23:36,972 --&gt; 00:23:40,058
And if this situation gets out
of hand, then he's to be terminated.</p>

<p>220
00:23:40,976 --&gt; 00:23:42,977
- And without hesitation!</p>

<p>221
00:23:42,978 --&gt; 00:23:44,562
- And without hesitation!
- Yes, Colonel.</p>

<p>222
00:23:45,022 --&gt; 00:23:47,982
This school is
your last chance!</p>

<p>223
00:23:48,192 --&gt; 00:23:50,568
If trash like you guys can't keep up with the
academic ability of regular students......</p>

<p>224
00:23:50,819 --&gt; 00:23:54,697
If you can't live a decent
social life, you end up here!</p>

<p>225
00:23:54,865 --&gt; 00:23:57,033
And if you screw up here,
it's the end of the road!</p>

<p>226
00:23:57,117 --&gt; 00:24:00,745
Also, even though you're under 15,
if you get more than 50 penalty points...</p>

<p>227
00:24:00,871 --&gt; 00:24:02,997
you're sent to the
regular court.</p>

<p>228
00:24:03,040 --&gt; 00:24:05,250
Aw, bite me. Don't mess
with us, you bald old goat.</p>

<p>229
00:24:05,292 --&gt; 00:24:07,252
Are you listening?</p>

<p>230
00:24:07,336 --&gt; 00:24:08,544
- You lost me halfway through.</p>

<p>231
00:24:08,545 --&gt; 00:24:09,879
- You lost me halfway through.
- Discipline!</p>

<p>232
00:24:10,005 --&gt; 00:24:15,009
Discipline! Discipline!</p>

<p>233
00:24:15,135 --&gt; 00:24:17,095
Discipline! Dismissed!</p>

<p>234
00:24:18,389 --&gt; 00:24:21,891
Thank you very much, sir.</p>

<p>235
00:24:22,893 --&gt; 00:24:26,062
- You loser! I'm gonna beat you up someday!</p>

<p>236
00:24:26,063 --&gt; 00:24:27,272
- You loser! I'm gonna beat you up someday!
- We're gonna remember this!</p>

<p>237
00:24:27,398 --&gt; 00:24:28,564
- Yeah, you sick mother!</p>

<p>238
00:24:28,565 --&gt; 00:24:31,276
- Yeah, you sick mother!
- Damn!</p>

<p>239
00:24:36,907 --&gt; 00:24:38,199
Hi, Yamagata!</p>

<p>240
00:24:38,325 --&gt; 00:24:40,702
What happened to your cheek?</p>

<p>241
00:24:40,744 --&gt; 00:24:41,744
- Don't bother me.</p>

<p>242
00:24:41,745 --&gt; 00:24:43,621
- Don't bother me.
- I heard you got into a fight.</p>

<p>243
00:24:43,747 --&gt; 00:24:46,874
My friends told me you fought
the Clowns on the highway in the old city.</p>

<p>244
00:24:46,917 --&gt; 00:24:47,625
Big deal.</p>

<p>245
00:24:47,751 --&gt; 00:24:50,461
Why didn't you wipe 'em out?
Those guys are so gross.</p>

<p>246
00:24:50,587 --&gt; 00:24:53,798
Clowns, demonstrators,
cops, the damn army...</p>

<p>247
00:24:53,924 --&gt; 00:24:55,967
and that idiot Tetsuo
had an accident!</p>

<p>248
00:24:56,093 --&gt; 00:24:57,802
What happened to Tetsuo?</p>

<p>249
00:24:57,886 --&gt; 00:24:59,637
He's in the hospital,
but we don't know where.</p>

<p>250
00:24:59,763 --&gt; 00:25:01,723
Dumb loser was trying
to show off.</p>

<p>251
00:25:01,765 --&gt; 00:25:02,974
Yeah, a real jerk.</p>

<p>252
00:25:05,269 --&gt; 00:25:06,477
Stupid idiot!</p>

<p>253
00:25:06,603 --&gt; 00:25:08,438
- You're talking about Tetsuo, right?</p>

<p>254
00:25:08,439 --&gt; 00:25:09,731
- You're talking about Tetsuo, right?
- Shut up already!</p>

<p>255
00:25:09,857 --&gt; 00:25:11,649
Why do you have to be hangin'
on my arm every minute?</p>

<p>256
00:25:11,692 --&gt; 00:25:13,151
What the heck has got into you?</p>

<p>257
00:25:28,792 --&gt; 00:25:32,170
Tetsuo, it's time
for your medicines.</p>

<p>258
00:25:33,464 --&gt; 00:25:35,840
Doctor, hurry!
The boy is gone!</p>

<p>259
00:25:39,803 --&gt; 00:25:44,682
No, I can't. You know the dorm mother always
throws a fit if you go out before 10:00.</p>

<p>260
00:25:44,808 --&gt; 00:25:49,687
Yeah, you know, the one with a face like a goat?
That woman is such a pain.</p>

<p>261
00:25:49,813 --&gt; 00:25:52,815
She's always complaining about us girls.
Huh? Tomorrow at 3:00?</p>

<p>262
00:25:52,941 --&gt; 00:25:58,321
Yeah, that's cool. Hey, what
happened to that girl? You know who.</p>

<p>263
00:25:58,447 --&gt; 00:26:02,325
I don't like her at all.
She gets on my nerves.</p>

<p>264
00:26:02,451 --&gt; 00:26:03,326
Kaori!</p>

<p>265
00:26:05,454 --&gt; 00:26:07,038
Tetsuo!</p>

<p>266
00:26:07,164 --&gt; 00:26:11,793
Everyone's been worried about you.
They thought you were dead.</p>

<p>267
00:26:17,966 --&gt; 00:26:22,720
When I woke up, I was on an
operating table or something.</p>

<p>268
00:26:22,846 --&gt; 00:26:25,556
That examination... Ohh!</p>

<p>269
00:26:25,682 --&gt; 00:26:28,726
It's like they were messing
around inside my head.</p>

<p>270
00:26:28,852 --&gt; 00:26:33,231
No, I don't want to go back
there again. We'll run away.</p>

<p>271
00:26:33,357 --&gt; 00:26:35,400
Where would we go to?</p>

<p>272
00:26:37,027 --&gt; 00:26:41,572
I don't know. Someplace.
Someplace far away.</p>

<p>273
00:26:47,371 --&gt; 00:26:48,996
Self study today!</p>

<p>274
00:26:49,039 --&gt; 00:26:50,581
Where'd the teacher go to?</p>

<p>275
00:26:50,707 --&gt; 00:26:54,419
What about my burning desire
to study and learn a vocation?</p>

<p>276
00:26:54,545 --&gt; 00:26:55,920
Drag his butt in here!</p>

<p>277
00:26:57,172 --&gt; 00:26:59,340
- Kaneda! Hurry! Your bike!</p>

<p>278
00:26:59,341 --&gt; 00:27:01,050
- Kaneda! Hurry! Your bike!
- What about my bike?</p>

<p>279
00:27:01,718 --&gt; 00:27:03,261
See? Look down there!</p>

<p>280
00:27:05,347 --&gt; 00:27:07,598
Wha... Tetsuo?</p>

<p>281
00:27:10,352 --&gt; 00:27:11,727
- Is this okay?</p>

<p>282
00:27:11,728 --&gt; 00:27:14,272
- Is this okay?
- Aw, quiet! Shut up and hang on!</p>

<p>283
00:27:25,826 --&gt; 00:27:26,325
- Huh? What the......</p>

<p>284
00:27:26,326 --&gt; 00:27:28,286
- Huh? What the......
- What's wrong?</p>

<p>285
00:27:28,412 --&gt; 00:27:30,037
- Uuh! Aw, Shit!</p>

<p>286
00:27:30,038 --&gt; 00:27:31,122
- Uuh! Aw, Shit!
- Ooh!</p>

<p>287
00:27:31,248 --&gt; 00:27:34,625
Oops, it's...stopping...
stopped......</p>

<p>288
00:27:35,752 --&gt; 00:27:40,131
I get it. The engine can't drop below 5,000 R.P.M.S
even when you're changing the gears.</p>

<p>289
00:27:40,215 --&gt; 00:27:41,174
- Ouch, my butt hurts.</p>

<p>290
00:27:41,175 --&gt; 00:27:42,133
- Ouch, my butt hurts.
- I understand now.</p>

<p>291
00:27:42,259 --&gt; 00:27:43,885
Look, some bikes.</p>

<p>292
00:27:45,262 --&gt; 00:27:49,307
Is that Kaneda and...
Wha... No, it isn't!</p>

<p>293
00:27:51,018 --&gt; 00:27:53,978
Oh, shit! Kaori!</p>

<p>294
00:27:57,774 --&gt; 00:27:58,649
Any sign of 'em?</p>

<p>295
00:27:59,234 --&gt; 00:28:01,319
Kuwata and the others went
to go look around Kisarazu.</p>

<p>296
00:28:01,445 --&gt; 00:28:04,780
The only place we haven't
searched now is the industrial area.</p>

<p>297
00:28:04,948 --&gt; 00:28:06,324
Okay! Let's go!</p>

<p>298
00:28:09,077 --&gt; 00:28:12,163
We owe you from the other night.
Now it's time for payback.</p>

<p>299
00:28:18,295 --&gt; 00:28:19,420
Whoo-hoo!</p>

<p>300
00:28:20,797 --&gt; 00:28:21,672
Shut up!</p>

<p>301
00:28:24,885 --&gt; 00:28:27,011
Kaori! What happened?</p>

<p>302
00:28:33,977 --&gt; 00:28:34,852
No, don't!</p>

<p>303
00:28:34,978 --&gt; 00:28:39,190
If you put a single scratch on that bike,
I'm gonna kill you asshole!</p>

<p>304
00:28:41,944 --&gt; 00:28:42,652
Huh?</p>

<p>305
00:28:45,155 --&gt; 00:28:46,197
Run!</p>

<p>306
00:28:46,323 --&gt; 00:28:48,282
After them!</p>

<p>307
00:28:54,122 --&gt; 00:28:55,665
No, wait.</p>

<p>308
00:29:05,509 --&gt; 00:29:07,885
Tetsuo!</p>

<p>309
00:29:24,027 --&gt; 00:29:26,487
You're gonna kill him, Tetsuo!
You want that?</p>

<p>310
00:29:26,613 --&gt; 00:29:29,490
I want him more than dead!
I'll split his friggin' head open!</p>

<p>311
00:29:29,616 --&gt; 00:29:31,325
Just knock it off now!</p>

<p>312
00:29:31,535 --&gt; 00:29:36,038
This whole thing happened because
you took my bike for a spin. Enough already.</p>

<p>313
00:29:36,164 --&gt; 00:29:39,208
Shut up! Don't order me around!</p>

<p>314
00:29:39,334 --&gt; 00:29:41,335
We were just worried.</p>

<p>315
00:29:41,461 --&gt; 00:29:44,171
Why do you always
have to try to save me?</p>

<p>316
00:29:45,716 --&gt; 00:29:47,592
I could handle it on my own.</p>

<p>317
00:29:47,718 --&gt; 00:29:53,681
I admit that I've gotten beaten before,
but I won't always be on the receiving end.</p>

<p>318
00:29:54,224 --&gt; 00:29:55,766
Do you understand?</p>

<p>319
00:30:00,147 --&gt; 00:30:01,022
Tetsuo......</p>

<p>320
00:30:02,149 --&gt; 00:30:04,900
Shut up! Go away!</p>

<p>321
00:30:07,070 --&gt; 00:30:09,280
Hey, wait! Where're you going?</p>

<p>322
00:30:10,991 --&gt; 00:30:11,949
Leave me alone!</p>

<p>323
00:30:14,828 --&gt; 00:30:16,579
"Akira!"</p>

<p>324
00:30:19,666 --&gt; 00:30:21,125
Tetsuo!</p>

<p>325
00:30:24,171 --&gt; 00:30:25,588
Something wrong?</p>

<p>326
00:30:26,506 --&gt; 00:30:27,214
"Akira!"</p>

<p>327
00:30:27,424 --&gt; 00:30:29,634
I don't know who that is!</p>

<p>328
00:30:51,615 --&gt; 00:30:54,158
Tetsuo... What's wrong?</p>

<p>329
00:30:59,956 --&gt; 00:31:04,335
This is really strange. I'm getting
a blue pattern on scope number 3.</p>

<p>330
00:31:04,461 --&gt; 00:31:07,838
What? No! Retrieve the
subject now! Hurry!</p>

<p>331
00:31:21,645 --&gt; 00:31:24,188
Why don't you guys
just leave my friend alone?</p>

<p>332
00:31:27,484 --&gt; 00:31:32,113
What's with the getup, huh?
You goin' to a funeral?</p>

<p>333
00:31:38,286 --&gt; 00:31:39,370
Tetsuo!</p>

<p>334
00:31:40,122 --&gt; 00:31:41,122
Kaneda!</p>

<p>335
00:31:42,499 --&gt; 00:31:43,874
Screw you!</p>

<p>336
00:31:53,343 --&gt; 00:31:55,177
No, wait!</p>

<p>337
00:32:00,684 --&gt; 00:32:03,144
Kaneda, what the hell's
goin' on?</p>

<p>338
00:32:12,863 --&gt; 00:32:16,741
Well, well. I see we have
some real hip youngsters...</p>

<p>339
00:32:16,867 --&gt; 00:32:20,244
doin' their thing in spite of the tight checkpoints
they got going around tonight.</p>

<p>340
00:32:20,370 --&gt; 00:32:23,748
And that just means that they're
all pretty stupid, doesn't it?</p>

<p>341
00:32:26,334 --&gt; 00:32:28,544
This is boring.</p>

<p>342
00:32:28,670 --&gt; 00:32:31,046
Hey, what do you say?
Let's go home.</p>

<p>343
00:32:31,173 --&gt; 00:32:33,549
What?
But it's still early.</p>

<p>344
00:32:33,675 --&gt; 00:32:37,553
Yeah, but without their bikes,
they're just tail chasers outta water.</p>

<p>345
00:32:37,679 --&gt; 00:32:39,013
You mean "fish".</p>

<p>346
00:32:39,055 --&gt; 00:32:41,724
Come on.
Let's go and toss these fish back.</p>

<p>347
00:32:42,476 --&gt; 00:32:45,561
Hey, Kaneda.
What are we gonna do?</p>

<p>348
00:32:48,190 --&gt; 00:32:49,482
- What the heck?</p>

<p>349
00:32:49,483 --&gt; 00:32:50,566
- What the heck?
- Look.</p>

<p>350
00:33:17,177 --&gt; 00:33:18,385
That's......</p>

<p>351
00:33:18,512 --&gt; 00:33:21,972
Here we go again. Look, let's get out of here
before we get caught up in it.</p>

<p>352
00:33:22,432 --&gt; 00:33:25,684
- Huh? Kaneda?</p>

<p>353
00:33:25,685 --&gt; 00:33:26,977
- Huh? Kaneda?
- Hey!</p>

<p>354
00:33:28,438 --&gt; 00:33:32,441
This area is being cordoned off
due to a terrorist bombing.</p>

<p>355
00:33:32,609 --&gt; 00:33:34,902
Those who wish to get through,
line up in single file...</p>

<p>356
00:33:35,028 --&gt; 00:33:37,905
present your I.D. and proceed
through the checkpoint.</p>

<p>357
00:33:48,708 --&gt; 00:33:51,168
Get in.
What's wrong? Hurry.</p>

<p>358
00:33:51,294 --&gt; 00:33:53,420
I'll meet you shortly.</p>

<p>359
00:33:53,547 --&gt; 00:33:55,673
You know the rendezvous point, right?</p>

<p>360
00:33:57,425 --&gt; 00:33:57,800
- Be careful.</p>

<p>361
00:33:57,801 --&gt; 00:34:00,678
- Be careful.
- You too. You be careful.</p>

<p>362
00:34:13,650 --&gt; 00:34:15,693
Hey! Hold it right there!</p>

<p>363
00:34:17,654 --&gt; 00:34:19,488
She's got a gun!</p>

<p>364
00:34:30,959 --&gt; 00:34:34,378
Okay, that's far enough!
All right, drop it!</p>

<p>365
00:34:42,304 --&gt; 00:34:43,304
Drop it!</p>

<p>366
00:34:49,352 --&gt; 00:34:50,561
Don't do it!</p>

<p>367
00:35:04,701 --&gt; 00:35:06,535
- I think it came from over here.</p>

<p>368
00:35:06,536 --&gt; 00:35:07,411
- I think it came from over here.
- There were two shots.</p>

<p>369
00:35:07,537 --&gt; 00:35:09,246
No, three.
It's just up ahead!</p>

<p>370
00:35:10,498 --&gt; 00:35:14,251
Hey! Let's get out of here.
Come on!</p>

<p>371
00:36:20,568 --&gt; 00:36:21,652
Kaneda!</p>

<p>372
00:36:47,637 --&gt; 00:36:51,348
There. Now what's the matter?
Talk about it.</p>

<p>373
00:36:51,474 --&gt; 00:36:54,351
It was a dream that I saw.</p>

<p>374
00:36:54,477 --&gt; 00:36:56,353
A dream?</p>

<p>375
00:36:57,814 --&gt; 00:37:02,860
The city started to crumble apart,
covered by a big shadow.</p>

<p>376
00:37:02,986 --&gt; 00:37:06,780
Lots of people died.
And the three of us...</p>

<p>377
00:37:06,906 --&gt; 00:37:09,158
we get to meet Akira again.</p>

<p>378
00:37:09,826 --&gt; 00:37:10,868
Wha... Akira?</p>

<p>379
00:37:11,411 --&gt; 00:37:13,954
The city will crumble......</p>

<p>380
00:37:14,080 --&gt; 00:37:17,666
So many people...
So many will die.</p>

<p>381
00:37:17,792 --&gt; 00:37:22,379
When will it happen?
Do you know when? Kiyoko!</p>

<p>382
00:37:22,505 --&gt; 00:37:25,466
You mustn't let that boy go.</p>

<p>383
00:37:25,675 --&gt; 00:37:27,885
His power, it......</p>

<p>384
00:37:35,268 --&gt; 00:37:36,018
- What's she talking about?</p>

<p>385
00:37:36,019 --&gt; 00:37:37,644
- What's she talking about?
- Well, there's, uh......</p>

<p>386
00:37:37,771 --&gt; 00:37:42,232
There seems to be nothing
physically wrong with her.</p>

<p>387
00:37:42,358 --&gt; 00:37:45,819
Her medication looks accurate.
There's no sign of any abnormalities...</p>

<p>388
00:37:45,945 --&gt; 00:37:48,238
in her EKG or her EEG either.</p>

<p>389
00:37:48,364 --&gt; 00:37:54,203
I think number 25's statement is probably
her precognitive power at work.</p>

<p>390
00:37:54,329 --&gt; 00:37:58,082
You know, this needs to be brought
before the supreme council for inquiry.</p>

<p>391
00:37:58,666 --&gt; 00:38:00,250
Do you believe her?</p>

<p>392
00:38:00,376 --&gt; 00:38:03,087
I have no doubts regarding
number 25's abilities.</p>

<p>393
00:38:03,213 --&gt; 00:38:05,506
We have lots of data
that substantiate it.</p>

<p>394
00:38:05,632 --&gt; 00:38:08,008
What do you believe, Colonel?</p>

<p>395
00:38:08,134 --&gt; 00:38:13,514
I'll tell you, my job isn't to believe
or disbelieve. It's to act or not act!</p>

<p>396
00:38:26,152 --&gt; 00:38:31,031
Here, sir. Cold gear, Colonel.
Please put it on. You too, doctor.</p>

<p>397
00:38:42,919 --&gt; 00:38:47,548
The other day, a young researcher came to me
and asked me something.</p>

<p>398
00:38:47,674 --&gt; 00:38:51,802
He wondered if their power was
the form of the next stage...</p>

<p>399
00:38:52,053 --&gt; 00:38:56,306
that human evolution was taking, and perhaps
we would all be able to control it some day.</p>

<p>400
00:38:56,432 --&gt; 00:38:59,810
Scientists are
a bunch of romantics.</p>

<p>401
00:39:00,103 --&gt; 00:39:03,564
Military men, on the other hand,
always consider the risks first.</p>

<p>402
00:39:03,690 --&gt; 00:39:06,066
Over 30 years it's taken.</p>

<p>403
00:39:06,192 --&gt; 00:39:09,736
We've come so far
crawling up from the rubble.</p>

<p>404
00:39:09,863 --&gt; 00:39:12,072
We can't just trade one
for the other.</p>

<p>405
00:39:12,198 --&gt; 00:39:15,284
But I've always thought that
you held a resentment...</p>

<p>406
00:39:15,285 --&gt; 00:39:17,119
even a hatred for this city, Colonel.</p>

<p>407
00:39:17,287 --&gt; 00:39:21,623
The passion to build has cooled,
and the joy of reconstruction forgotten.</p>

<p>408
00:39:21,916 --&gt; 00:39:26,086
Now... Now it's just a garbage heap made up of
a bunch of hedonistic fools.</p>

<p>409
00:39:26,212 --&gt; 00:39:30,090
But in spite of that,
you're trying to save the city.</p>

<p>410
00:39:30,216 --&gt; 00:39:33,635
I'm not a scientist.
I think like a soldier.</p>

<p>411
00:39:37,473 --&gt; 00:39:39,349
Colonel, we're here, sir.</p>

<p>412
00:39:39,475 --&gt; 00:39:41,351
This way, please.</p>

<p>413
00:40:01,497 --&gt; 00:40:04,875
Room 10, 148 degrees Kelvin.</p>

<p>414
00:40:05,001 --&gt; 00:40:08,212
Fluctuation tolerance range, check.</p>

<p>415
00:40:08,338 --&gt; 00:40:10,380
Room 9, 118 degrees Kelvin.</p>

<p>416
00:40:10,506 --&gt; 00:40:12,549
Fluctuation tolerance, check.</p>

<p>417
00:40:12,675 --&gt; 00:40:15,010
Emergency power generator, check.</p>

<p>418
00:40:15,637 --&gt; 00:40:16,470
- Open the door.</p>

<p>419
00:40:16,471 --&gt; 00:40:18,222
- Open the door.
- Sir. Um...</p>

<p>420
00:40:18,348 --&gt; 00:40:19,681
- The control room. Do it!</p>

<p>421
00:40:19,682 --&gt; 00:40:20,474
- The control room. Do it!
- Yes, sir!</p>

<p>422
00:40:37,617 --&gt; 00:40:41,912
Room 1 is at 0.0005 degrees Kelvin.</p>

<p>423
00:40:42,038 --&gt; 00:40:45,999
It's within tolerance range.
No abnormalities detected in any of the rooms...</p>

<p>424
00:40:46,125 --&gt; 00:40:48,502
dewar walls or defense system.</p>

<p>425
00:40:48,628 --&gt; 00:40:52,422
No abnormal atmospheric concentrations
or reactions recorded.</p>

<p>426
00:40:52,548 --&gt; 00:40:54,925
So then all systems are normal.</p>

<p>427
00:41:03,851 --&gt; 00:41:06,103
Look at what they abandoned
in their panic.</p>

<p>428
00:41:06,229 --&gt; 00:41:10,190
They were afraid. They were too scared,
so they hid it away from the public...</p>

<p>429
00:41:10,316 --&gt; 00:41:14,945
losing all sense of shame and honor,
casting aside the civilization...</p>

<p>430
00:41:15,071 --&gt; 00:41:17,572
and abandoning the science
that created it.</p>

<p>431
00:41:17,699 --&gt; 00:41:22,119
Shutting the lid of the Pandora's
box they, themselves, had opened!</p>

<p>432
00:41:26,416 --&gt; 00:41:27,082
- Ryu!</p>

<p>433
00:41:27,083 --&gt; 00:41:29,126
- Ryu!
- Hey, we're still young.</p>

<p>434
00:41:29,294 --&gt; 00:41:29,543
- Ryu!</p>

<p>435
00:41:29,544 --&gt; 00:41:31,420
- Ryu!
- We could start over again.</p>

<p>436
00:41:32,255 --&gt; 00:41:33,588
- I'll go with you.</p>

<p>437
00:41:33,589 --&gt; 00:41:34,381
- I'll go with you.
- Ryu!</p>

<p>438
00:41:34,590 --&gt; 00:41:36,133
Turn yourself in!</p>

<p>439
00:41:36,259 --&gt; 00:41:38,218
This was the first time
you killed a man, right?</p>

<p>440
00:41:38,261 --&gt; 00:41:38,927
- Ryu!</p>

<p>441
00:41:38,928 --&gt; 00:41:41,972
- Ryu!
- Anyway, when you get out...</p>

<p>442
00:41:42,265 --&gt; 00:41:46,560
let's go out for drinks.
Don't kick yourself over it.</p>

<p>443
00:41:46,686 --&gt; 00:41:50,480
What's done is done.
You've heard that.</p>

<p>444
00:41:56,529 --&gt; 00:41:58,989
Identify yourselves!</p>

<p>445
00:42:00,074 --&gt; 00:42:02,492
Ryu! Oh, are you all right?</p>

<p>446
00:42:02,618 --&gt; 00:42:03,285
- Kei, it's you!</p>

<p>447
00:42:03,286 --&gt; 00:42:04,661
- Kei, it's you!
- Ryu!</p>

<p>448
00:42:05,288 --&gt; 00:42:06,997
Who's this?</p>

<p>449
00:42:07,457 --&gt; 00:42:09,333
Who? Me?</p>

<p>450
00:42:09,459 --&gt; 00:42:13,420
Well, I guess if I say that I'm Kei's
boyfriend, it's stretching it a bit.</p>

<p>451
00:42:13,463 --&gt; 00:42:15,172
It depends on your point of view.</p>

<p>452
00:42:15,381 --&gt; 00:42:17,799
But we haven't gotten
physical or anything.</p>

<p>453
00:42:17,967 --&gt; 00:42:18,800
- You understand, don't you?</p>

<p>454
00:42:18,801 --&gt; 00:42:19,468
- You understand, don't you?
- Are you a spy?</p>

<p>455
00:42:19,552 --&gt; 00:42:20,135
- No, I'm not!</p>

<p>456
00:42:20,136 --&gt; 00:42:21,178
- No, I'm not!
- You're lying!</p>

<p>457
00:42:26,142 --&gt; 00:42:27,809
- Well, is he a spy or not?</p>

<p>458
00:42:27,810 --&gt; 00:42:30,687
- Well, is he a spy or not?
- Whatever he is, he's certainly not a spy.</p>

<p>459
00:42:31,064 --&gt; 00:42:32,981
Ow!</p>

<p>460
00:42:34,484 --&gt; 00:42:36,443
Sneak into their lab?</p>

<p>461
00:42:36,569 --&gt; 00:42:39,279
Ridiculous!
Remember the fiasco with that kid?</p>

<p>462
00:42:39,405 --&gt; 00:42:42,657
They're last-minute orders,
and the plan is in place already.</p>

<p>463
00:42:45,995 --&gt; 00:42:48,372
These are the lab passes
they issue once a week.</p>

<p>464
00:42:48,498 --&gt; 00:42:50,624
From Mr. Nezu, right?</p>

<p>465
00:42:50,750 --&gt; 00:42:52,626
What's the objective?</p>

<p>466
00:42:52,752 --&gt; 00:42:55,045
We're to gather detailed
data on the new subject.</p>

<p>467
00:42:55,171 --&gt; 00:42:56,922
- A new subject?</p>

<p>468
00:42:56,923 --&gt; 00:42:58,048
- A new subject?
- Yes.</p>

<p>469
00:42:58,174 --&gt; 00:43:03,053
Last week, on the same night we tried to abduct
the experimental subject called number 26...</p>

<p>470
00:43:03,179 --&gt; 00:43:07,891
a boy who was in an accident
on an old city highway was brought to the lab.</p>

<p>471
00:43:08,017 --&gt; 00:43:10,852
It seems that he's a student
at a vocational training school...</p>

<p>472
00:43:10,978 --&gt; 00:43:14,147
but now he's their new subject
for human experimentation.</p>

<p>473
00:43:14,273 --&gt; 00:43:15,357
Huh?</p>

<p>474
00:43:18,277 --&gt; 00:43:20,570
Ow, ouch!!</p>

<p>475
00:43:20,696 --&gt; 00:43:23,490
Hey, hey, hey!
What's the big idea?</p>

<p>476
00:43:23,616 --&gt; 00:43:24,699
You!</p>

<p>477
00:43:24,700 --&gt; 00:43:26,284
- Should I kill him? He heard us.</p>

<p>478
00:43:26,285 --&gt; 00:43:26,993
- Should I kill him? He heard us.
- Ryu?</p>

<p>479
00:43:27,120 --&gt; 00:43:30,997
Wait! Now just hold on a minute!
Hear me out. Please listen to me!</p>

<p>480
00:43:31,124 --&gt; 00:43:32,416
Ryu, he did save me.</p>

<p>481
00:43:32,542 --&gt; 00:43:33,542
- Yeah! Twice!</p>

<p>482
00:43:33,543 --&gt; 00:43:35,502
- Yeah! Twice!
- Maybe he did it just to get close to us.</p>

<p>483
00:43:35,628 --&gt; 00:43:39,005
The guy who was in that accident
in the old city is my friend.</p>

<p>484
00:43:39,132 --&gt; 00:43:42,259
I know it's hard for you to believe
what I'm saying, but it's the truth.</p>

<p>485
00:43:42,385 --&gt; 00:43:44,344
I was right there when it happened!</p>

<p>486
00:43:45,388 --&gt; 00:43:49,266
Come on! Don't they say
the only foolish questions are unasked ones?</p>

<p>487
00:43:50,435 --&gt; 00:43:51,726
They don't?</p>

<p>488
00:43:53,521 --&gt; 00:43:56,606
That's an intriguing story, isn't it?</p>

<p>489
00:43:56,732 --&gt; 00:43:59,568
Well, will you be
taking the boy with you?</p>

<p>490
00:43:59,694 --&gt; 00:44:03,697
He knows the subject and I think we can
use him as a decoy if we find it necessary.</p>

<p>491
00:44:03,823 --&gt; 00:44:07,284
Neo Tokyo is going
to change soon.</p>

<p>492
00:44:08,161 --&gt; 00:44:11,121
In all respects,
this city is saturated.</p>

<p>493
00:44:11,247 --&gt; 00:44:13,290
It's like an overripe fruit.</p>

<p>494
00:44:13,416 --&gt; 00:44:15,959
Buried within it is a new seed.</p>

<p>495
00:44:16,210 --&gt; 00:44:19,880
We need only wait for the wind
which will make it fall to fruition......</p>

<p>496
00:44:20,214 --&gt; 00:44:22,299
The wind called "Akira".</p>

<p>497
00:44:23,593 --&gt; 00:44:25,760
Ryu, look over here.</p>

<p>498
00:44:27,096 --&gt; 00:44:28,263
What is it?</p>

<p>499
00:44:28,347 --&gt; 00:44:30,724
We aren't the ones who will change it...</p>

<p>500
00:44:30,933 --&gt; 00:44:33,894
but rather, those citizens
who hope for Akira that will.</p>

<p>501
00:44:35,271 --&gt; 00:44:38,648
That which is called science
perverts providence!</p>

<p>502
00:44:38,774 --&gt; 00:44:41,568
That which is called progress
encourages extravagance!</p>

<p>503
00:44:41,694 --&gt; 00:44:45,155
That which is called civilization
devastates the spirit of man!</p>

<p>504
00:44:45,281 --&gt; 00:44:48,909
The time of atonement is upon us!
Are your hearts prepared?</p>

<p>505
00:44:49,118 --&gt; 00:44:53,497
The time is nigh!
The time of his awakening is nigh!</p>

<p>506
00:44:53,623 --&gt; 00:44:56,833
The moment of lord Akira's
awakening is drawing closer!</p>

<p>507
00:44:56,959 --&gt; 00:44:58,043
- Are your minds prepared?</p>

<p>508
00:44:58,044 --&gt; 00:45:00,128
- Are your minds prepared?
- Break it up!</p>

<p>509
00:45:00,129 --&gt; 00:45:02,422
Holding meetings here
is prohibited.</p>

<p>510
00:45:02,465 --&gt; 00:45:04,508
This gathering is illegal!</p>

<p>511
00:45:05,468 --&gt; 00:45:09,429
Terrorist activities carried out
by antigovernment elements...</p>

<p>512
00:45:09,555 --&gt; 00:45:11,181
have skyrocketed this month.</p>

<p>513
00:45:11,474 --&gt; 00:45:15,769
The army, riot squad and even the traffic police
have been fully mobilized.</p>

<p>514
00:45:15,895 --&gt; 00:45:18,855
The overtime costs alone have
used up the public safety budget.</p>

<p>515
00:45:18,981 --&gt; 00:45:21,191
And then there's
the abduction of number 26.</p>

<p>516
00:45:21,317 --&gt; 00:45:24,528
Isn't their existence supposed to be the highest
of state secrets, Colonel?</p>

<p>517
00:45:24,654 --&gt; 00:45:28,031
No one's ever heard of peace
and order in Neo Tokyo then?</p>

<p>518
00:45:28,157 --&gt; 00:45:32,035
And this, this request of yours
for further... Ah, yes...</p>

<p>519
00:45:32,161 --&gt; 00:45:36,790
for further funding because of
subject number 25's prediction.</p>

<p>520
00:45:36,958 --&gt; 00:45:41,211
You must be joking! While straightening out the
historic tax-reform blunders...</p>

<p>521
00:45:41,337 --&gt; 00:45:44,381
of our former Prime Minister, we parliament members
have been bowing our heads down...</p>

<p>522
00:45:44,507 --&gt; 00:45:46,716
and begging the public
to bear with us.</p>

<p>523
00:45:46,842 --&gt; 00:45:51,888
And what does he ask for? Money!
Where, exactly, do we get that kind of money?</p>

<p>524
00:45:52,181 --&gt; 00:45:53,723
You've already spent
a fortune here...</p>

<p>525
00:45:53,849 --&gt; 00:45:56,560
and all we have to show for it
is that grotesque kindergarten!</p>

<p>526
00:45:56,852 --&gt; 00:45:59,354
The Olympics is next year,
and the postwar period is over.</p>

<p>527
00:45:59,480 --&gt; 00:46:02,983
How much longer will you keep throwing
away money on these worthless ghosts?</p>

<p>528
00:46:03,109 --&gt; 00:46:06,528
I always said we should put that
money into the welfare program!</p>

<p>529
00:46:06,612 --&gt; 00:46:07,696
Shut up, old man!</p>

<p>530
00:46:07,697 --&gt; 00:46:08,530
What was that?</p>

<p>531
00:46:08,614 --&gt; 00:46:12,158
Now listen here! That power is starting
to walk around free as we speak.</p>

<p>532
00:46:12,285 --&gt; 00:46:17,080
Unless we control that power now, we'll lose
everything we tried so hard to achieve.</p>

<p>533
00:46:17,206 --&gt; 00:46:20,917
- Take that "old man" comment back!
- Your lack of policy started this mess!</p>

<p>534
00:46:21,127 --&gt; 00:46:25,380
There's still no proof that the last world war was
caused by Akira, in my opinion.</p>

<p>535
00:46:25,548 --&gt; 00:46:26,923
Don't you understand?</p>

<p>536
00:46:27,008 --&gt; 00:46:31,428
Unless an Akira disaster actually happens...
Don't you people understand anything?</p>

<p>537
00:46:31,887 --&gt; 00:46:34,347
Has anyone ever seen the "Akira"...?</p>

<p>538
00:46:34,515 --&gt; 00:46:36,766
Akira was number 25, wasn't he?</p>

<p>539
00:46:36,976 --&gt; 00:46:38,518
He should be number 21.</p>

<p>540
00:46:38,728 --&gt; 00:46:41,771
I say that the colonel has lost
sight of his duty as a soldier!</p>

<p>541
00:46:42,982 --&gt; 00:46:47,110
And I have had several reports on
antigovernment elements...</p>

<p>542
00:46:47,236 --&gt; 00:46:51,239
how they're using your Akira madness
to whip up their terrorist fervor.</p>

<p>543
00:46:51,324 --&gt; 00:46:52,949
It's not true. It's just not!</p>

<p>544
00:46:53,409 --&gt; 00:46:55,577
Then what about that
Akira world renewal movement?</p>

<p>545
00:46:55,828 --&gt; 00:46:57,704
Wouldn't you say that
information's being leaked?</p>

<p>546
00:46:57,913 --&gt; 00:47:01,124
World renewal movement?
It's more like the end of the world.</p>

<p>547
00:47:01,417 --&gt; 00:47:05,253
Aren't you just using Akira as camouflage
to cover up your misconduct? Admit it!</p>

<p>548
00:47:05,421 --&gt; 00:47:06,963
What are you getting at?</p>

<p>549
00:47:07,173 --&gt; 00:47:08,548
Colonel......</p>

<p>550
00:47:08,841 --&gt; 00:47:15,805
Understand that we can no longer leave the
peace of Neo Tokyo to your sole discretion.</p>

<p>551
00:47:15,931 --&gt; 00:47:16,973
Get rid of him!</p>

<p>552
00:47:17,016 --&gt; 00:47:20,310
I'm sorry, but you are to be
put before an inquiry committee.</p>

<p>553
00:47:20,436 --&gt; 00:47:21,645
He should be suspended!</p>

<p>554
00:47:25,441 --&gt; 00:47:26,441
Excuse me!</p>

<p>555
00:47:26,776 --&gt; 00:47:27,776
What?</p>

<p>556
00:47:28,611 --&gt; 00:47:30,445
This discussion isn't over!</p>

<p>557
00:47:30,613 --&gt; 00:47:31,696
- This is an outrage!</p>

<p>558
00:47:31,697 --&gt; 00:47:33,448
- This is an outrage!
- You should explain yourself!</p>

<p>559
00:47:33,616 --&gt; 00:47:35,992
Are you trying to insult
the supreme executive council?</p>

<p>560
00:48:01,310 --&gt; 00:48:02,477
Water.</p>

<p>561
00:48:35,636 --&gt; 00:48:37,512
Hey. Wait a minute.</p>

<p>562
00:48:37,805 --&gt; 00:48:41,224
Let's see. Isn't that cable
replacement due for next week?</p>

<p>563
00:48:41,517 --&gt; 00:48:44,978
Well, the cable they ordered
came in a whole week early.</p>

<p>564
00:48:45,104 --&gt; 00:48:49,232
And besides, I've got vacation time
coming, and I'm leaving this weekend.</p>

<p>565
00:48:49,358 --&gt; 00:48:52,026
If I bring the workers back,
there'll be overtime.</p>

<p>566
00:48:52,361 --&gt; 00:48:56,823
I could leave now and come back,
but the work's gotta be done sooner or later.</p>

<p>567
00:49:02,037 --&gt; 00:49:03,997
All right, guys. Let's go.</p>

<p>568
00:50:34,296 --&gt; 00:50:35,338
What the...!</p>

<p>569
00:51:05,452 --&gt; 00:51:07,287
It's milk.</p>

<p>570
00:51:14,962 --&gt; 00:51:15,962
Stay away!</p>

<p>571
00:51:21,844 --&gt; 00:51:23,720
- Whaa!
- Whoa!</p>

<p>572
00:51:29,351 --&gt; 00:51:30,184
- It's blood!</p>

<p>573
00:51:30,185 --&gt; 00:51:32,145
- It's blood!
- I'm scared.</p>

<p>574
00:51:40,321 --&gt; 00:51:41,529
Weirdo!</p>

<p>575
00:51:41,697 --&gt; 00:51:44,240
What? Those kids......</p>

<p>576
00:52:40,089 --&gt; 00:52:43,299
"Patient, Room 887.
Shima, Tetsuo."</p>

<p>577
00:52:43,425 --&gt; 00:52:45,885
Oh. The automatic lock's off?</p>

<p>578
00:52:51,016 --&gt; 00:52:54,060
Hey, you! You're not
allowed to leave your room!</p>

<p>579
00:52:59,233 --&gt; 00:53:00,817
Let's go back into your room.</p>

<p>580
00:53:00,943 --&gt; 00:53:02,193
- What happened?</p>

<p>581
00:53:02,194 --&gt; 00:53:03,778
- What happened?
- Looks terrible.</p>

<p>582
00:53:25,968 --&gt; 00:53:30,179
There are 58 blocks with circuits
that the computer won't display.</p>

<p>583
00:53:30,305 --&gt; 00:53:34,183
Of those, nearly 40 are concentrated
on underground levels 7 and 8.</p>

<p>584
00:53:34,309 --&gt; 00:53:36,019
That's probably the place.</p>

<p>585
00:53:38,147 --&gt; 00:53:41,024
The central wiring shaft
should be straight up ahead.</p>

<p>586
00:53:41,483 --&gt; 00:53:44,193
We'll be able to use that to go
straight down to the sublevels.</p>

<p>587
00:53:45,320 --&gt; 00:53:48,489
Be careful.
It's deeper in the middle.</p>

<p>588
00:53:48,741 --&gt; 00:53:50,158
Whew. What a stink.</p>

<p>589
00:53:50,159 --&gt; 00:53:51,367
Don't you ever stop talking?</p>

<p>590
00:53:51,452 --&gt; 00:53:55,371
I said it stinks because it stinks.
Is your nose busted?</p>

<p>591
00:53:55,497 --&gt; 00:53:57,123
Keep up and be quiet!</p>

<p>592
00:53:58,333 --&gt; 00:54:00,543
Damn! Hug the walls!</p>

<p>593
00:54:00,669 --&gt; 00:54:02,879
Huh?
What are you guys doing?</p>

<p>594
00:54:03,005 --&gt; 00:54:05,298
You idiot, get down!</p>

<p>595
00:54:20,355 --&gt; 00:54:22,231
Looks like they beefed up security,
doesn't it?</p>

<p>596
00:54:22,357 --&gt; 00:54:23,608
- Must be that siren we heard.</p>

<p>597
00:54:23,609 --&gt; 00:54:25,318
- Must be that siren we heard.
- Should we scout a way around it?</p>

<p>598
00:54:25,527 --&gt; 00:54:26,944
- No. Let's keep going.</p>

<p>599
00:54:26,945 --&gt; 00:54:28,071
- No. Let's keep going.
- Hey. Are you okay?</p>

<p>600
00:54:28,155 --&gt; 00:54:31,157
I want to check their security
at the very least.</p>

<p>601
00:54:31,700 --&gt; 00:54:33,826
Damn! They spotted us!
Run for it!</p>

<p>602
00:54:35,871 --&gt; 00:54:37,997
Don't shoot! Hold your fire!</p>

<p>603
00:54:41,543 --&gt; 00:54:43,419
Shimazaki!</p>

<p>604
00:54:43,879 --&gt; 00:54:45,505
- You assholes!</p>

<p>605
00:54:45,506 --&gt; 00:54:47,173
- You assholes!
- Forget it! Run!</p>

<p>606
00:54:50,552 --&gt; 00:54:52,261
What the hell is that thing?</p>

<p>607
00:54:54,056 --&gt; 00:54:55,056
It's coming back!</p>

<p>608
00:54:56,016 --&gt; 00:54:57,391
Don't shoot!</p>

<p>609
00:55:05,400 --&gt; 00:55:07,443
This is unit 304, Shaft "H".</p>

<p>610
00:55:07,569 --&gt; 00:55:10,947
I have encountered intruders.
Requesting backup. Now engaging.</p>

<p>611
00:55:12,074 --&gt; 00:55:13,783
Here it comes!</p>

<p>612
00:55:38,684 --&gt; 00:55:40,393
Oh! Kei!</p>

<p>613
00:55:42,771 --&gt; 00:55:44,897
The gun!</p>

<p>614
00:55:45,274 --&gt; 00:55:46,899
Damn it!</p>

<p>615
00:55:49,444 --&gt; 00:55:50,820
Kaneda!</p>

<p>616
00:56:00,789 --&gt; 00:56:02,832
Kei! Over here!</p>

<p>617
00:56:03,792 --&gt; 00:56:05,168
Now!</p>

<p>618
00:56:06,879 --&gt; 00:56:09,088
Kaneda, come on! Hurry!</p>

<p>619
00:56:23,979 --&gt; 00:56:25,271
Kaneda, no!</p>

<p>620
00:56:38,619 --&gt; 00:56:40,620
What the hell...
Where are the brakes?</p>

<p>621
00:56:40,746 --&gt; 00:56:42,413
- That's not it.</p>

<p>622
00:56:42,414 --&gt; 00:56:44,624
- That's not it.
- This is the central wiring shaft, I think.</p>

<p>623
00:56:44,750 --&gt; 00:56:45,666
- I can't figure it out!</p>

<p>624
00:56:45,667 --&gt; 00:56:46,626
- I can't figure it out!
- What the......</p>

<p>625
00:56:52,341 --&gt; 00:56:54,550
There now.
That's right. Behave.</p>

<p>626
00:56:54,801 --&gt; 00:56:57,345
Ask the colonel for clearance
on the use of firearms.</p>

<p>627
00:56:57,471 --&gt; 00:56:59,222
Hey. Turn the radio up.</p>

<p>628
00:56:59,348 --&gt; 00:57:00,973
There must be some mistake here.</p>

<p>629
00:57:01,016 --&gt; 00:57:03,893
That boy looks like the patient
admitted in the lab.</p>

<p>630
00:57:04,019 --&gt; 00:57:07,063
Correct. Tetsuo Shima.
He broke out of his ward.</p>

<p>631
00:57:07,189 --&gt; 00:57:09,190
- He's headed for "the baby room".</p>

<p>632
00:57:09,191 --&gt; 00:57:10,399
- He's headed for "the baby room".
- It's Tetsuo?</p>

<p>633
00:57:10,525 --&gt; 00:57:15,821
He's extremely dangerous.
Do not let him through!</p>

<p>634
00:57:43,225 --&gt; 00:57:45,226
Huh? What...?</p>

<p>635
00:57:52,567 --&gt; 00:57:54,443
It's no use hiding anymore.</p>

<p>636
00:57:54,820 --&gt; 00:57:56,946
We have no choice, then.
Use your guns!</p>

<p>637
00:57:57,072 --&gt; 00:58:00,449
We can't let him go any further,
no matter what it takes!</p>

<p>638
00:58:01,243 --&gt; 00:58:02,285
Fire!</p>

<p>639
00:58:41,950 --&gt; 00:58:44,160
Good. All here, are you?</p>

<p>640
00:58:49,958 --&gt; 00:58:51,125
Stop it!</p>

<p>641
00:58:53,628 --&gt; 00:58:56,005
So how long are you gonna
keep playing around?</p>

<p>642
00:59:03,221 --&gt; 00:59:04,847
Where's the other one
hiding, huh?</p>

<p>643
00:59:06,141 --&gt; 00:59:07,641
Hey, you!
You're a cretin!</p>

<p>644
00:59:07,809 --&gt; 00:59:08,642
Huh?</p>

<p>645
00:59:08,977 --&gt; 00:59:10,353
Die!</p>

<p>646
00:59:13,231 --&gt; 00:59:14,690
Takashi!</p>

<p>647
00:59:24,826 --&gt; 00:59:29,830
What the hell is going on
with me? Am I dreaming?</p>

<p>648
00:59:30,165 --&gt; 00:59:33,209
These powers, are they real
or just a hallucination?</p>

<p>649
00:59:40,842 --&gt; 00:59:42,885
Damn it!
Where the hell am I going?</p>

<p>650
00:59:43,095 --&gt; 00:59:46,389
Proceed straight.
Proceed straight ahead.</p>

<p>651
00:59:46,932 --&gt; 00:59:47,807
Huh?</p>

<p>652
00:59:47,849 --&gt; 00:59:49,892
You'll find a freight elevator just ahead.</p>

<p>653
00:59:52,187 --&gt; 00:59:54,980
You can take it down
to sublevel 8.</p>

<p>654
01:00:03,198 --&gt; 01:00:05,866
That's good.
You're all together.</p>

<p>655
01:00:07,202 --&gt; 01:00:08,744
You thought you could kill me?</p>

<p>656
01:00:09,037 --&gt; 01:00:10,746
I'm through with it.</p>

<p>657
01:00:10,872 --&gt; 01:00:14,750
You tried to mess with me,
and now I'm gonna kill you!</p>

<p>658
01:00:15,127 --&gt; 01:00:16,252
Huh?</p>

<p>659
01:00:20,882 --&gt; 01:00:22,925
You were there. I remember.</p>

<p>660
01:00:23,301 --&gt; 01:00:24,093
Takashi!</p>

<p>661
01:00:24,219 --&gt; 01:00:24,718
- Huh?</p>

<p>662
01:00:24,719 --&gt; 01:00:26,262
- Huh?
- Together, let's attack him.</p>

<p>663
01:00:26,847 --&gt; 01:00:27,847
O...Okay.</p>

<p>664
01:00:33,061 --&gt; 01:00:35,020
You little twerps!</p>

<p>665
01:00:51,079 --&gt; 01:00:53,038
All of you, that is enough!</p>

<p>666
01:01:01,590 --&gt; 01:01:03,716
Who the hell are you?</p>

<p>667
01:01:06,761 --&gt; 01:01:09,472
What's the matter?
Is your head hurting?</p>

<p>668
01:01:09,598 --&gt; 01:01:12,475
Tetsuo Shima, your power
isn't fully matured yet.</p>

<p>669
01:01:12,559 --&gt; 01:01:16,437
If you push yourself, you might do
irreparable damage. We can help.</p>

<p>670
01:01:16,688 --&gt; 01:01:20,316
What the hell?
What...did you people do?</p>

<p>671
01:01:20,442 --&gt; 01:01:21,817
You messed with my head!</p>

<p>672
01:01:30,202 --&gt; 01:01:32,119
Tetsuo Shima, calm yourself.</p>

<p>673
01:01:32,245 --&gt; 01:01:34,163
But he can't control it, sir.</p>

<p>674
01:01:39,544 --&gt; 01:01:40,628
What'd you say?</p>

<p>675
01:01:40,795 --&gt; 01:01:43,005
She said that big people
like you...</p>

<p>676
01:01:43,131 --&gt; 01:01:45,841
should never use the power
in the way that you are.</p>

<p>677
01:01:45,967 --&gt; 01:01:47,843
And bad things will come of it.</p>

<p>678
01:01:48,261 --&gt; 01:01:50,638
Mind your own business,
will you?</p>

<p>679
01:01:53,391 --&gt; 01:01:56,685
What?
More powerful than I am now?</p>

<p>680
01:01:59,314 --&gt; 01:02:03,859
He's the one! He's the one who's been
invading my head all along!</p>

<p>681
01:02:04,152 --&gt; 01:02:05,110
Where is he?</p>

<p>682
01:02:05,237 --&gt; 01:02:07,154
Where's this "Akira"?
Tell me now!</p>

<p>683
01:02:07,322 --&gt; 01:02:07,947
What?</p>

<p>684
01:02:08,073 --&gt; 01:02:12,034
Kiyoko says you'll wake him up
and if you awaken Akira like that...</p>

<p>685
01:02:12,160 --&gt; 01:02:14,703
when that happens,
no one will be able to stop him.</p>

<p>686
01:02:14,829 --&gt; 01:02:16,705
To prevent it,
we have to stop you.</p>

<p>687
01:02:17,082 --&gt; 01:02:18,999
Ridiculous. Akira's already...!</p>

<p>688
01:02:19,000 --&gt; 01:02:21,043
Where is he?</p>

<p>689
01:02:23,296 --&gt; 01:02:24,338
- No! Don't!</p>

<p>690
01:02:24,339 --&gt; 01:02:25,464
- No! Don't!
- Stay back!</p>

<p>691
01:02:31,429 --&gt; 01:02:35,224
Red level to facility integrity
has passed level 7.</p>

<p>692
01:02:35,350 --&gt; 01:02:38,227
Enacting disaster protocol.</p>

<p>693
01:02:39,437 --&gt; 01:02:42,856
Red level to facility integrity
has passed level 7.</p>

<p>694
01:02:43,024 --&gt; 01:02:45,901
Enacting disaster protocol.</p>

<p>695
01:02:46,486 --&gt; 01:02:47,570
Wha...?!</p>

<p>696
01:02:54,869 --&gt; 01:02:56,870
Hands up! Now!</p>

<p>697
01:02:59,499 --&gt; 01:03:01,584
Where in the hell's
the friggin' baby room?</p>

<p>698
01:03:20,562 --&gt; 01:03:22,855
Heads up!</p>

<p>699
01:03:22,981 --&gt; 01:03:24,857
Coming through!</p>

<p>700
01:03:26,234 --&gt; 01:03:27,776
Kiyoko.</p>

<p>701
01:03:48,256 --&gt; 01:03:49,548
That hurt.</p>

<p>702
01:03:49,758 --&gt; 01:03:50,633
Kaneda.</p>

<p>703
01:03:51,009 --&gt; 01:03:53,135
What are you doing in here?</p>

<p>704
01:03:55,930 --&gt; 01:03:58,807
Tetsuo! You okay?
I'm here to rescue you.</p>

<p>705
01:04:01,394 --&gt; 01:04:03,228
Hurry up!
What are you, stupid?</p>

<p>706
01:04:03,355 --&gt; 01:04:05,397
If we don't get
out of here, those...</p>

<p>707
01:04:06,107 --&gt; 01:04:07,149
Huh?</p>

<p>708
01:04:07,359 --&gt; 01:04:09,818
There he is! Capture him!</p>

<p>709
01:04:11,446 --&gt; 01:04:13,614
You keep away!</p>

<p>710
01:04:18,286 --&gt; 01:04:19,453
Kaneda!</p>

<p>711
01:04:21,873 --&gt; 01:04:24,333
Oh, that's right.
I forgot you were there.</p>

<p>712
01:04:26,461 --&gt; 01:04:28,420
There. Do you see, Kaneda?</p>

<p>713
01:04:28,546 --&gt; 01:04:32,299
I won't be needing you to come
to the rescue ever again, okay?</p>

<p>714
01:04:33,134 --&gt; 01:04:36,011
From now on, I'll be in
charge of the heroics...</p>

<p>715
01:04:36,221 --&gt; 01:04:39,306
so if you need any saving,
just ask, Kanny.</p>

<p>716
01:04:39,557 --&gt; 01:04:43,852
Damn it, Tetsuo. Who the hell do you think
you're talking to, you moron?</p>

<p>717
01:04:44,813 --&gt; 01:04:48,023
Ha! You don't like
what you're hearing, do you?</p>

<p>718
01:04:48,149 --&gt; 01:04:51,360
Makes you angry. So what are
you gonna do now?</p>

<p>719
01:04:51,486 --&gt; 01:04:54,697
Well, Kaneda?
What are you gonna do now?</p>

<p>720
01:05:04,666 --&gt; 01:05:06,375
That's enough!</p>

<p>721
01:05:07,001 --&gt; 01:05:09,878
Stop it!
Don't hurt anyone else!</p>

<p>722
01:05:11,423 --&gt; 01:05:13,382
Where's this Akira?</p>

<p>723
01:05:14,175 --&gt; 01:05:15,050
I won't tell.</p>

<p>724
01:05:16,344 --&gt; 01:05:19,054
Olympic stadium...
Underground.</p>

<p>725
01:05:19,514 --&gt; 01:05:22,558
No! Don't! What you're
thinking is wrong! Akira is......</p>

<p>726
01:05:24,602 --&gt; 01:05:25,811
Oh! Wait!</p>

<p>727
01:05:35,905 --&gt; 01:05:36,947
What the hell?</p>

<p>728
01:05:37,782 --&gt; 01:05:40,367
I can do this too?</p>

<p>729
01:05:46,541 --&gt; 01:05:48,542
Kiyoko, are you all right?</p>

<p>730
01:05:48,793 --&gt; 01:05:50,377
It doesn't look like she's hurt.</p>

<p>731
01:05:50,545 --&gt; 01:05:53,380
What about you, Masaru?
You're bleeding.</p>

<p>732
01:05:53,381 --&gt; 01:05:54,882
Where'd he go to?</p>

<p>733
01:05:55,800 --&gt; 01:05:56,842
He flew away.</p>

<p>734
01:05:56,885 --&gt; 01:05:59,011
How can he have so
much power?</p>

<p>735
01:06:01,473 --&gt; 01:06:03,265
How could this have happened?</p>

<p>736
01:06:03,391 --&gt; 01:06:05,350
Damn it!
Where are my men at?</p>

<p>737
01:06:05,477 --&gt; 01:06:09,021
He's developed so much power
in such a short time, it's unbelievable.</p>

<p>738
01:06:09,397 --&gt; 01:06:11,523
Find him!
Start searching for Tetsuo.</p>

<p>739
01:06:11,816 --&gt; 01:06:12,149
- Find him!</p>

<p>740
01:06:12,150 --&gt; 01:06:14,276
- Find him!
- Kaneda, come on! Get up!</p>

<p>741
01:06:15,236 --&gt; 01:06:17,446
Somebody, help me
with this rock.</p>

<p>742
01:06:20,074 --&gt; 01:06:21,575
- Tetsuo went to where Akira is.</p>

<p>743
01:06:21,576 --&gt; 01:06:22,284
- Tetsuo went to where Akira is.
- What?</p>

<p>744
01:06:22,911 --&gt; 01:06:25,788
That's good.
You're all safe.</p>

<p>745
01:06:25,914 --&gt; 01:06:29,625
He's heading for the facility below
the Olympic construction site.</p>

<p>746
01:06:29,751 --&gt; 01:06:31,794
How'd he find out about it?</p>

<p>747
01:06:35,590 --&gt; 01:06:38,884
Damn it! You're saying
that he's managed to escape?</p>

<p>748
01:06:42,388 --&gt; 01:06:44,973
Then we'll follow him.
Prepare for pursuit!</p>

<p>749
01:06:45,183 --&gt; 01:06:46,266
- He's heading west toward the stadium.</p>

<p>750
01:06:46,267 --&gt; 01:06:48,310
- He's heading west toward the stadium.
- Come on! Move!</p>

<p>751
01:06:48,353 --&gt; 01:06:51,647
I want additional checkpoints on all outbound
streets leading to the construction site.</p>

<p>752
01:06:52,190 --&gt; 01:06:53,816
It was you.</p>

<p>753
01:07:00,198 --&gt; 01:07:02,074
According
to the security team...</p>

<p>754
01:07:02,200 --&gt; 01:07:04,827
reviews of tapes showed five
intruders disguised as workers...</p>

<p>755
01:07:04,953 --&gt; 01:07:06,662
entering the wiring shaft.</p>

<p>756
01:07:06,788 --&gt; 01:07:09,832
I have to stop him
before his powers mature.</p>

<p>757
01:07:12,210 --&gt; 01:07:13,961
Your objective is the boy,
Tetsuo Shima.</p>

<p>758
01:07:14,212 --&gt; 01:07:18,257
If we are unable to capture him,
we'll lure him out to the old city and attack.</p>

<p>759
01:07:18,383 --&gt; 01:07:20,759
Request assistance from
the Eastern district battalion.</p>

<p>760
01:07:20,885 --&gt; 01:07:21,468
- Yes, sir.</p>

<p>761
01:07:21,469 --&gt; 01:07:23,971
- Yes, sir.
- Tell them there isn't a moment to lose here.</p>

<p>762
01:07:26,057 --&gt; 01:07:28,016
I've been waiting here
a long time, Colonel.</p>

<p>763
01:07:29,269 --&gt; 01:07:31,436
What are you doing here?</p>

<p>764
01:07:32,647 --&gt; 01:07:36,859
I'm here to inform you of the supreme
executive council's decision.</p>

<p>765
01:07:38,611 --&gt; 01:07:41,154
"At 2400 hours today,
the colonel is hereby..."</p>

<p>766
01:07:41,281 --&gt; 01:07:43,156
"stripped of his command
and rank..."</p>

<p>767
01:07:43,283 --&gt; 01:07:45,200
"and shall be placed
under arrest."</p>

<p>768
01:07:45,493 --&gt; 01:07:47,202
What the hell?</p>

<p>769
01:07:47,495 --&gt; 01:07:49,830
Kindly accompany us now.</p>

<p>770
01:07:50,081 --&gt; 01:07:54,877
You really expect me to hand Neo Tokyo
over to those fools at a time like this?</p>

<p>771
01:07:56,462 --&gt; 01:07:57,504
- Shoot him.</p>

<p>772
01:07:57,505 --&gt; 01:07:58,338
- Shoot him.
- Yes, sir.</p>

<p>773
01:07:58,631 --&gt; 01:08:01,717
What? No! Wait!
Hold on! No!</p>

<p>774
01:08:03,678 --&gt; 01:08:07,180
Enough! Open your eyes
and look at the big picture!</p>

<p>775
01:08:07,307 --&gt; 01:08:09,892
You're all puppets of corrupt
politicians and capitalists!</p>

<p>776
01:08:14,814 --&gt; 01:08:18,233
Don't you understand?
It's utterly pointless to fight each other.</p>

<p>777
01:08:22,530 --&gt; 01:08:27,075
Announce a state of emergency,
and arrest all members of the executive council.</p>

<p>778
01:08:27,201 --&gt; 01:08:29,202
Break their chain of command.</p>

<p>779
01:08:29,329 --&gt; 01:08:31,413
Lift off!
We're going after Tetsuo.</p>

<p>780
01:08:31,706 --&gt; 01:08:33,415
Urgent message. Repeat, urgent.</p>

<p>781
01:08:33,541 --&gt; 01:08:35,417
To all district
battalion commanders.</p>

<p>782
01:08:45,386 --&gt; 01:08:49,097
Yo! What's up?
You're alone?</p>

<p>783
01:08:51,059 --&gt; 01:08:53,936
That's right.
Weren't you in an accident?</p>

<p>784
01:08:54,062 --&gt; 01:08:56,939
Your friends have been
really worried. You okay?</p>

<p>785
01:08:57,231 --&gt; 01:08:59,691
Give me some...capsules.</p>

<p>786
01:09:00,026 --&gt; 01:09:02,736
Huh? You sure
you want capsules, son?</p>

<p>787
01:09:02,862 --&gt; 01:09:04,780
You look kinda woozy.</p>

<p>788
01:09:05,073 --&gt; 01:09:06,782
You better get 'em now.</p>

<p>789
01:09:07,241 --&gt; 01:09:08,116
All right.</p>

<p>790
01:09:08,242 --&gt; 01:09:11,954
Whatever the customer wants, you know,
but with all those terrorist attacks lately...</p>

<p>791
01:09:12,080 --&gt; 01:09:14,581
and the demonstrations,
things are pretty rough.</p>

<p>792
01:09:14,832 --&gt; 01:09:18,877
In fact, they're hard to come by, so the price
is pretty expensive, right?</p>

<p>793
01:09:25,093 --&gt; 01:09:28,136
Tetsuo's run off somewhere,
Kaneda's disappeared.</p>

<p>794
01:09:28,262 --&gt; 01:09:29,888
Damn, I guess
the team is finished.</p>

<p>795
01:09:29,931 --&gt; 01:09:32,599
And the checkpoints are
so strict these days.</p>

<p>796
01:09:32,767 --&gt; 01:09:34,977
Even the Clowns are
laying low.</p>

<p>797
01:09:44,070 --&gt; 01:09:45,195
Look!</p>

<p>798
01:09:49,283 --&gt; 01:09:50,659
He's dead!</p>

<p>799
01:09:50,743 --&gt; 01:09:51,576
What?</p>

<p>800
01:09:53,371 --&gt; 01:09:55,247
Who's that?</p>

<p>801
01:10:01,129 --&gt; 01:10:02,254
It's Tetsuo.</p>

<p>802
01:10:02,380 --&gt; 01:10:06,091
Why... Why are you here?</p>

<p>803
01:10:06,968 --&gt; 01:10:09,594
Look who's here.
Wanna pop one?</p>

<p>804
01:10:09,971 --&gt; 01:10:11,596
What the hell are you talking about?</p>

<p>805
01:10:11,723 --&gt; 01:10:13,181
What happened here?</p>

<p>806
01:10:13,725 --&gt; 01:10:15,851
Did you notice that
the owner's dead?</p>

<p>807
01:10:19,230 --&gt; 01:10:22,024
An octopus out of water dies, huh?</p>

<p>808
01:10:22,316 --&gt; 01:10:24,943
Are you...Tetsuo...</p>

<p>809
01:10:25,069 --&gt; 01:10:26,486
- or someone else?</p>

<p>810
01:10:26,487 --&gt; 01:10:27,195
- or someone else?
- Huh?</p>

<p>811
01:10:28,322 --&gt; 01:10:30,365
Kaneda sends
his warmest regards.</p>

<p>812
01:10:30,491 --&gt; 01:10:32,200
You saw Kaneda?</p>

<p>813
01:10:32,452 --&gt; 01:10:34,453
He's probably dead by now.</p>

<p>814
01:10:37,498 --&gt; 01:10:41,376
You did this, didn't you?</p>

<p>815
01:10:41,502 --&gt; 01:10:45,881
All you're good for now is telling
me where Kaneda's bike is.</p>

<p>816
01:10:46,007 --&gt; 01:10:47,549
Tetsuo!</p>

<p>817
01:10:47,675 --&gt; 01:10:50,218
It's a piece of shit anyway.</p>

<p>818
01:10:50,344 --&gt; 01:10:52,387
You son of a bitch!</p>

<p>819
01:10:57,518 --&gt; 01:10:58,685
Yamagata!</p>

<p>820
01:11:05,318 --&gt; 01:11:07,736
Goddamn it!</p>

<p>821
01:11:14,535 --&gt; 01:11:16,328
So is he off to find Akira?</p>

<p>822
01:11:16,496 --&gt; 01:11:18,413
Yes, that's what that girl was saying.</p>

<p>823
01:11:18,706 --&gt; 01:11:20,665
Now, the army,
Ryu and yourself...</p>

<p>824
01:11:20,792 --&gt; 01:11:23,001
are all trying at once
to find this Akira guy...</p>

<p>825
01:11:23,127 --&gt; 01:11:25,253
and that's also why you're
chasing after Tetsuo.</p>

<p>826
01:11:25,505 --&gt; 01:11:28,381
It must have to do
with the powers he's got.</p>

<p>827
01:11:28,508 --&gt; 01:11:31,510
What the hell is this Akira thing?</p>

<p>828
01:11:34,222 --&gt; 01:11:36,598
I asked Ryu one time.</p>

<p>829
01:11:36,724 --&gt; 01:11:39,851
He told me that Akira
is ultimate energy.</p>

<p>830
01:11:40,019 --&gt; 01:11:41,770
"Ultimate energy"?</p>

<p>831
01:11:41,896 --&gt; 01:11:45,941
Humans do all kinds of things
during their lifetime, right?</p>

<p>832
01:11:46,067 --&gt; 01:11:48,110
Discover things......</p>

<p>833
01:11:48,236 --&gt; 01:11:50,695
Build things......</p>

<p>834
01:11:50,822 --&gt; 01:11:53,115
Things like houses, motorcycles...</p>

<p>835
01:11:54,200 --&gt; 01:11:57,452
bridges and cities, rockets......</p>

<p>836
01:11:58,246 --&gt; 01:12:01,456
So where do you suppose all that
knowledge and energy comes from?</p>

<p>837
01:12:03,709 --&gt; 01:12:06,461
Humans were once
like monkeys, right?</p>

<p>838
01:12:07,171 --&gt; 01:12:09,131
And before that,
like reptiles...</p>

<p>839
01:12:09,257 --&gt; 01:12:10,882
and fish...</p>

<p>840
01:12:10,925 --&gt; 01:12:14,469
and even before that,
plankton and amoebas.</p>

<p>841
01:12:14,595 --&gt; 01:12:18,974
Even little creatures like those
have incredible amount of energy inside them.</p>

<p>842
01:12:19,392 --&gt; 01:12:22,644
Oh, yes...
It's in the genes, right?</p>

<p>843
01:12:23,020 --&gt; 01:12:24,646
And even before that.</p>

<p>844
01:12:24,772 --&gt; 01:12:27,983
Maybe there was genetic
material in the air and water...</p>

<p>845
01:12:28,109 --&gt; 01:12:29,985
even in the particles
of dust in space.</p>

<p>846
01:12:30,403 --&gt; 01:12:34,739
And if that's the truth, then what sort of memories
are hidden within them?</p>

<p>847
01:12:34,949 --&gt; 01:12:38,827
The beginning of the universe?
Or maybe even before that.</p>

<p>848
01:12:38,953 --&gt; 01:12:42,831
What's with all the crazy talk?
Are you sure you're okay?</p>

<p>849
01:12:42,957 --&gt; 01:12:45,292
Listen to yourself. Did you get
bonked on the head back there?</p>

<p>850
01:12:45,585 --&gt; 01:12:48,837
And what if everyone shares
those ancient memories?</p>

<p>851
01:12:49,130 --&gt; 01:12:52,132
What if there were some mistakes
in the progression?</p>

<p>852
01:12:52,258 --&gt; 01:12:54,801
Then something goes wrong,
like an amoeba is suddenly given...</p>

<p>853
01:12:54,927 --&gt; 01:12:57,012
the higher powers
that a human has.</p>

<p>854
01:12:58,556 --&gt; 01:13:00,307
Akira is an amoeba then?</p>

<p>855
01:13:01,309 --&gt; 01:13:04,019
Amoebas don't build their own
houses and bridges, do they?</p>

<p>856
01:13:04,395 --&gt; 01:13:07,105
They just devour all the food
they can find around them.</p>

<p>857
01:13:07,315 --&gt; 01:13:09,482
Is that what Tetsuo's doing?</p>

<p>858
01:13:09,609 --&gt; 01:13:11,610
Are you saying he has
that kind of energy?</p>

<p>859
01:13:11,986 --&gt; 01:13:13,695
Long ago...</p>

<p>860
01:13:13,821 --&gt; 01:13:16,990
there were people who tried
to gain control of that power.</p>

<p>861
01:13:17,116 --&gt; 01:13:19,159
That is, all of the government's
requests.</p>

<p>862
01:13:19,327 --&gt; 01:13:23,663
But they failed in their attempt,
and it triggered the fall of Tokyo.</p>

<p>863
01:13:24,749 --&gt; 01:13:26,625
And that power is...</p>

<p>864
01:13:26,751 --&gt; 01:13:28,710
something that is
totally beyond our......</p>

<p>865
01:13:30,671 --&gt; 01:13:31,630
Wha...!</p>

<p>866
01:13:32,506 --&gt; 01:13:33,673
The door's unlocked.</p>

<p>867
01:13:37,511 --&gt; 01:13:38,637
Huh?</p>

<p>868
01:13:43,935 --&gt; 01:13:47,187
It's a trap.
This is just too good of a setup.</p>

<p>869
01:13:47,313 --&gt; 01:13:48,188
- Go back, then.</p>

<p>870
01:13:48,189 --&gt; 01:13:49,189
- Go back, then.
- No way.</p>

<p>871
01:13:49,315 --&gt; 01:13:51,816
I wanna find out how much
of a trap it is, don't you?</p>

<p>872
01:13:53,778 --&gt; 01:13:55,737
By the way...</p>

<p>873
01:13:55,863 --&gt; 01:13:58,573
what's going on with you
and that Ryu guy?</p>

<p>874
01:13:58,699 --&gt; 01:14:00,367
What in the world
are you talking about?</p>

<p>875
01:14:00,534 --&gt; 01:14:01,493
- You're always together.</p>

<p>876
01:14:01,494 --&gt; 01:14:03,161
- You're always together.
- That's none of your business.</p>

<p>877
01:14:04,497 --&gt; 01:14:06,081
No, wait. Hear me out.</p>

<p>878
01:14:06,290 --&gt; 01:14:09,167
What I'm saying is, he doesn't
know about us, does he?</p>

<p>879
01:14:09,377 --&gt; 01:14:13,505
"About us"? Hey, wait a minute.
What's that supposed to mean?</p>

<p>880
01:14:13,673 --&gt; 01:14:15,215
- Do you think it'll work?</p>

<p>881
01:14:15,216 --&gt; 01:14:17,008
- Do you think it'll work?
- It can't be helped.</p>

<p>882
01:14:17,134 --&gt; 01:14:21,388
At this point in time, our only
option left is to use her.</p>

<p>883
01:14:21,514 --&gt; 01:14:23,598
Well, the fact that,
without us even looking...</p>

<p>884
01:14:23,724 --&gt; 01:14:26,268
she turned up right under
our noses, says as much.</p>

<p>885
01:14:26,394 --&gt; 01:14:28,395
- What do you think?</p>

<p>886
01:14:28,396 --&gt; 01:14:29,562
- What do you think?
- I guess so.</p>

<p>887
01:14:43,911 --&gt; 01:14:47,789
We have arrived at ward 13,
East Ginza intersection. Over.</p>

<p>888
01:14:47,915 --&gt; 01:14:50,542
Northern district battalion has not
responded to mobilization request!</p>

<p>889
01:14:51,419 --&gt; 01:14:53,962
Special search team to H.Q.
Special search team to H.Q.</p>

<p>890
01:14:54,255 --&gt; 01:14:57,549
We're at the Harukiya bar near
the highway interchange at ward 8.</p>

<p>891
01:14:57,717 --&gt; 01:15:01,469
It doesn't look like a bomb explosion
to us, so we think it was him.</p>

<p>892
01:15:01,595 --&gt; 01:15:04,055
No, sir, it wasn't
a gas explosion either.</p>

<p>893
01:15:04,348 --&gt; 01:15:07,475
It was almost certainly the work of
the subject that escaped from the lab.</p>

<p>894
01:15:08,436 --&gt; 01:15:10,312
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Understood.</p>

<p>895
01:15:16,569 --&gt; 01:15:18,820
Kaneda, wait!</p>

<p>896
01:15:19,947 --&gt; 01:15:22,324
What? Yamagata's dead?</p>

<p>897
01:15:22,575 --&gt; 01:15:25,452
Something seemed strange about him
the second I saw his face.</p>

<p>898
01:15:25,578 --&gt; 01:15:28,163
It's odd. He was wearing what
looked like a white hospital gown.</p>

<p>899
01:15:28,289 --&gt; 01:15:30,332
He acted like a different person.</p>

<p>900
01:15:31,792 --&gt; 01:15:34,336
Yamagata asked him
if he was really Tetsuo...</p>

<p>901
01:15:34,378 --&gt; 01:15:35,920
or if he was someone else.</p>

<p>902
01:15:36,380 --&gt; 01:15:40,842
And then he... Yamagata!
Why?</p>

<p>903
01:15:43,888 --&gt; 01:15:46,014
We've always been together.</p>

<p>904
01:15:46,140 --&gt; 01:15:48,183
I've known everything
about him ever...</p>

<p>905
01:15:50,311 --&gt; 01:15:52,854
ever since we were
in the children's home together.</p>

<p>906
01:15:52,980 --&gt; 01:15:56,524
They tease... Everybody
tried to make him cry.</p>

<p>907
01:15:58,152 --&gt; 01:16:01,363
Oh. He really wanted to know
where your bike was at.</p>

<p>908
01:16:01,989 --&gt; 01:16:04,199
Where my bike was?</p>

<p>909
01:16:12,500 --&gt; 01:16:14,459
What are you gonna do?</p>

<p>910
01:16:15,002 --&gt; 01:16:17,379
I'm gonna go send
Yamagata his wheels.</p>

<p>911
01:16:22,009 --&gt; 01:16:24,386
You dumb bastard!</p>

<p>912
01:16:27,807 --&gt; 01:16:29,182
Kaneda!</p>

<p>913
01:16:45,449 --&gt; 01:16:46,408
Kei!</p>

<p>914
01:16:46,867 --&gt; 01:16:48,076
What's wrong?</p>

<p>915
01:16:52,373 --&gt; 01:16:54,874
That night. You were there.</p>

<p>916
01:16:58,879 --&gt; 01:17:00,213
Wait!</p>

<p>917
01:17:06,053 --&gt; 01:17:07,220
Kei!</p>

<p>918
01:17:11,475 --&gt; 01:17:12,934
They're gone!</p>

<p>919
01:17:14,353 --&gt; 01:17:17,439
You're the one, right?
You changed my friend, didn't you?</p>

<p>920
01:17:17,690 --&gt; 01:17:19,399
The thing about Akira's power is...</p>

<p>921
01:17:19,525 --&gt; 01:17:22,110
it exists within everyone
from the start.</p>

<p>922
01:17:22,236 --&gt; 01:17:23,778
Hey, who is that?</p>

<p>923
01:17:25,239 --&gt; 01:17:27,866
But when that power
is awakened inside...</p>

<p>924
01:17:27,992 --&gt; 01:17:31,286
it is important to wisely
choose how to use it.</p>

<p>925
01:17:31,745 --&gt; 01:17:34,122
When the time comes,
you might not know it...</p>

<p>926
01:17:34,248 --&gt; 01:17:36,416
let alone be prepared for it.</p>

<p>927
01:17:37,418 --&gt; 01:17:40,295
Your friend
has already made his choice.</p>

<p>928
01:17:41,922 --&gt; 01:17:43,965
Tetsuo is our newest companion.</p>

<p>929
01:17:44,091 --&gt; 01:17:46,134
He's our friend also.</p>

<p>930
01:17:47,428 --&gt; 01:17:49,304
His actions are out of control...</p>

<p>931
01:17:49,430 --&gt; 01:17:51,306
and for that
we're partly to blame too.</p>

<p>932
01:17:51,599 --&gt; 01:17:54,309
Great! Then what in the hell
did you take Kei for?</p>

<p>933
01:17:54,602 --&gt; 01:17:57,312
We're hoping she'll be able
to help us in some way.</p>

<p>934
01:17:57,605 --&gt; 01:18:00,648
They're people, not toys!
Bring her back to me!</p>

<p>935
01:18:00,774 --&gt; 01:18:02,817
And Tetsuo's our friend,
not yours!</p>

<p>936
01:18:02,943 --&gt; 01:18:04,986
If someone's gonna kill him,
it should be us!</p>

<p>937
01:18:07,781 --&gt; 01:18:08,823
Hey!</p>

<p>938
01:18:11,744 --&gt; 01:18:15,830
Are you sure? Mr. Omi and the others
have been arrested in the coup d'etat?</p>

<p>939
01:18:16,123 --&gt; 01:18:20,335
Yes, that's right. The house guards
are fighting them right now.</p>

<p>940
01:18:20,461 --&gt; 01:18:24,506
Yes. I'd like to have
a helicopter waiting. Yes.</p>

<p>941
01:18:26,091 --&gt; 01:18:29,093
That damn Colonel! I can't
believe he's taken up arms.</p>

<p>942
01:18:31,805 --&gt; 01:18:33,765
I've underestimated him.</p>

<p>943
01:18:38,312 --&gt; 01:18:40,188
Hold them here!</p>

<p>944
01:19:10,761 --&gt; 01:19:13,137
Mr. Nezu, I......</p>

<p>945
01:19:13,514 --&gt; 01:19:16,140
Oh! Ryu, is that you?</p>

<p>946
01:19:16,433 --&gt; 01:19:18,393
I came to apologize, sir.</p>

<p>947
01:19:18,519 --&gt; 01:19:20,728
The mission was a failure.</p>

<p>948
01:19:21,021 --&gt; 01:19:24,857
Damn you! I told you,
you can't be seen here!</p>

<p>949
01:19:26,485 --&gt; 01:19:29,070
My two best men, they're dead.</p>

<p>950
01:19:29,280 --&gt; 01:19:30,572
Everyone was killed.</p>

<p>951
01:19:30,656 --&gt; 01:19:33,700
You bastard! You sold me out!</p>

<p>952
01:19:33,826 --&gt; 01:19:35,201
What?</p>

<p>953
01:19:38,372 --&gt; 01:19:39,706
Kei!</p>

<p>954
01:19:53,345 --&gt; 01:19:54,554
What?</p>

<p>955
01:19:54,847 --&gt; 01:19:56,556
Yeah, 7th avenue
is just up ahead.</p>

<p>956
01:19:56,682 --&gt; 01:19:59,601
It intersects this road
a hundred meters from here.</p>

<p>957
01:20:03,564 --&gt; 01:20:05,189
Battle stations!</p>

<p>958
01:20:13,574 --&gt; 01:20:17,076
Right! The subject
has been spotted.</p>

<p>959
01:20:17,202 --&gt; 01:20:19,537
What? Attack the kid?</p>

<p>960
01:20:19,580 --&gt; 01:20:23,291
But, sir, he's just a boy!
We can't attack him!</p>

<p>961
01:20:27,755 --&gt; 01:20:28,880
- Look! There he is!</p>

<p>962
01:20:28,881 --&gt; 01:20:29,797
- Look! There he is!
- It's impossible.</p>

<p>963
01:20:29,882 --&gt; 01:20:31,049
Is this for real?</p>

<p>964
01:20:42,728 --&gt; 01:20:44,562
Fire range preparations
are complete.</p>

<p>965
01:20:47,274 --&gt; 01:20:49,067
Damn it! Fire!</p>

<p>966
01:21:02,081 --&gt; 01:21:04,749
Is it Akira?</p>

<p>967
01:21:04,875 --&gt; 01:21:06,751
Look, it's Lord Akira!</p>

<p>968
01:21:07,628 --&gt; 01:21:09,629
Don't be fooled! This isn't the rapture!</p>

<p>969
01:21:09,755 --&gt; 01:21:11,172
He's a false messiah!</p>

<p>970
01:21:13,133 --&gt; 01:21:15,635
Long live Akira!</p>

<p>971
01:21:16,136 --&gt; 01:21:17,512
Fire!</p>

<p>972
01:21:18,639 --&gt; 01:21:19,722
- What the......</p>

<p>973
01:21:19,723 --&gt; 01:21:21,015
- What the......
- What's wrong?</p>

<p>974
01:22:48,562 --&gt; 01:22:51,272
Coming to you live aboard news
chopper 1 high over downtown.</p>

<p>975
01:22:51,398 --&gt; 01:22:54,275
Neo Tokyo broadcasting is exclusively
covering the news today...</p>

<p>976
01:22:54,401 --&gt; 01:22:57,111
in spite of martial law, in the
name of freedom of the press.</p>

<p>977
01:22:57,196 --&gt; 01:22:59,614
What in the world is happening
here in Neo Tokyo?</p>

<p>978
01:22:59,740 --&gt; 01:23:02,784
What you see here seem to be
fires caused by tank cannons.</p>

<p>979
01:23:02,910 --&gt; 01:23:07,288
But who is this boy standing alone?
Is he fighting the coup d'etat forces by himself?</p>

<p>980
01:23:07,748 --&gt; 01:23:09,457
I'm sorry.
We've been ordered to land.</p>

<p>981
01:23:09,583 --&gt; 01:23:11,793
The army has just illegally
ordered us to land!</p>

<p>982
01:23:11,919 --&gt; 01:23:15,254
What is at stake here is freedom of
the press! We've been ordered to...</p>

<p>983
01:23:16,256 --&gt; 01:23:17,590
- Did they just get cut off?</p>

<p>984
01:23:17,591 --&gt; 01:23:18,716
- Did they just get cut off?
- What was that?</p>

<p>985
01:23:18,842 --&gt; 01:23:21,135
The bridge!
He's heading for the bridge!</p>

<p>986
01:23:40,948 --&gt; 01:23:42,782
Are you sure you want
to do this alone?</p>

<p>987
01:23:43,784 --&gt; 01:23:45,785
This is what he wants,
isn't it?</p>

<p>988
01:23:46,411 --&gt; 01:23:48,830
At least give me time
to get the gang together.</p>

<p>989
01:23:49,414 --&gt; 01:23:50,957
Hey, wait!</p>

<p>990
01:23:51,083 --&gt; 01:23:53,417
I wouldn't want to keep him
waiting now, would I?</p>

<p>991
01:23:55,420 --&gt; 01:23:57,338
Hey, Kaneda, hold on!</p>

<p>992
01:24:03,971 --&gt; 01:24:07,306
Half of them seem to be antigovernment
demonstrators. The rest are......</p>

<p>993
01:24:07,391 --&gt; 01:24:11,519
They're more like some
crazy cult than onlookers.</p>

<p>994
01:24:11,645 --&gt; 01:24:14,814
They're following after the subject,
and more and more keep coming.</p>

<p>995
01:24:17,985 --&gt; 01:24:19,986
Flames of supreme purity...</p>

<p>996
01:24:20,112 --&gt; 01:24:22,613
rain down and raze
the corrupt city...</p>

<p>997
01:24:22,739 --&gt; 01:24:26,200
and drown forever all the
unclean believers of our time!</p>

<p>998
01:24:26,326 --&gt; 01:24:28,202
Give yourselves
into the flame, children...</p>

<p>999
01:24:28,328 --&gt; 01:24:30,496
and all of you
shall be reborn again!</p>

<p>1000
01:24:30,622 --&gt; 01:24:32,498
Now consume our heart.</p>

<p>1001
01:24:32,624 --&gt; 01:24:35,334
Wash our unclean hearts
in the eternal fire!</p>

<p>1002
01:24:35,460 --&gt; 01:24:38,629
Your body is going to be
purified in the flames!</p>

<p>1003
01:24:39,464 --&gt; 01:24:41,299
Ready!</p>

<p>1004
01:24:42,009 --&gt; 01:24:42,508
- What?</p>

<p>1005
01:24:42,509 --&gt; 01:24:43,718
- What?
- Fire!</p>

<p>1006
01:24:49,600 --&gt; 01:24:52,560
Set the switch to hold for 3 seconds.
Then converge your beams.</p>

<p>1007
01:24:53,687 --&gt; 01:24:55,730
Aim, fire!</p>

<p>1008
01:25:01,862 --&gt; 01:25:03,738
Watch this!</p>

<p>1009
01:25:09,870 --&gt; 01:25:12,413
Look out!
Let's get out of here!</p>

<p>1010
01:25:21,048 --&gt; 01:25:24,091
Save me!</p>

<p>1011
01:25:30,891 --&gt; 01:25:33,434
Ground forces.
Ground forces, come in.</p>

<p>1012
01:25:33,560 --&gt; 01:25:35,603
Report immediately.
What is the subject's status?</p>

<p>1013
01:25:35,854 --&gt; 01:25:37,897
Do you read?</p>

<p>1014
01:25:39,066 --&gt; 01:25:40,733
Line to the doctor.</p>

<p>1015
01:25:40,901 --&gt; 01:25:44,111
We have confirmation of his recent
movements and are in pursuit.</p>

<p>1016
01:25:44,237 --&gt; 01:25:46,572
His present position is...</p>

<p>1017
01:25:46,657 --&gt; 01:25:51,118
coordinates 99871 by 4332.</p>

<p>1018
01:25:51,745 --&gt; 01:25:54,622
That's about 2 kilometers south of
the Olympic construction site...</p>

<p>1019
01:25:54,748 --&gt; 01:25:55,790
in the old city.</p>

<p>1020
01:25:55,916 --&gt; 01:25:56,749
What?</p>

<p>1021
01:26:02,214 --&gt; 01:26:04,090
Where did that blast
come from?</p>

<p>1022
01:26:04,216 --&gt; 01:26:05,174
- Look!</p>

<p>1023
01:26:05,175 --&gt; 01:26:06,050
- Look!
- Huh?</p>

<p>1024
01:26:06,218 --&gt; 01:26:10,054
That must be out over at the tollbooth
being guarded by the second platoon.</p>

<p>1025
01:26:11,723 --&gt; 01:26:13,224
What the hell?</p>

<p>1026
01:26:16,436 --&gt; 01:26:20,314
Please turn around now.
This area is off-limits to civilians.</p>

<p>1027
01:26:20,399 --&gt; 01:26:23,442
Huh? What? That's
the escaped subject? Stop!</p>

<p>1028
01:26:23,610 --&gt; 01:26:25,820
Don't come any closer!
Stop, damn it!</p>

<p>1029
01:27:30,635 --&gt; 01:27:34,180
Nice place you have here, isn't it?</p>

<p>1030
01:27:41,188 --&gt; 01:27:44,356
You are the girl
that was with Kaneda.</p>

<p>1031
01:27:44,483 --&gt; 01:27:48,402
You shouldn't use your power in this way,
for it is not correct.</p>

<p>1032
01:27:48,528 --&gt; 01:27:50,154
What's that?</p>

<p>1033
01:27:50,280 --&gt; 01:27:54,909
Because in the end, you won't be able to
control it, and it will control you.</p>

<p>1034
01:27:55,035 --&gt; 01:27:57,995
It's the kids talking.
You're those brats, right?</p>

<p>1035
01:28:16,223 --&gt; 01:28:18,265
Nice one!</p>

<p>1036
01:28:39,871 --&gt; 01:28:41,789
What's going on?</p>

<p>1037
01:28:52,259 --&gt; 01:28:53,801
It's not safe here, Colonel!</p>

<p>1038
01:29:34,968 --&gt; 01:29:37,344
All right now. Next move.</p>

<p>1039
01:31:04,557 --&gt; 01:31:05,933
Open now!</p>

<p>1040
01:31:16,903 --&gt; 01:31:18,946
What the hell is this?</p>

<p>1041
01:31:19,030 --&gt; 01:31:21,699
That is Akira before you,
Tetsuo.</p>

<p>1042
01:31:21,825 --&gt; 01:31:23,784
That's the Akira
you wanted to meet!</p>

<p>1043
01:31:23,910 --&gt; 01:31:27,746
There is your messiah, the chosen one that
you've been looking for.</p>

<p>1044
01:31:27,872 --&gt; 01:31:30,624
Not long after
his transcendental awakening...</p>

<p>1045
01:31:30,750 --&gt; 01:31:33,961
his organs and tissues were subjected to
every test known to modern science.</p>

<p>1046
01:31:34,087 --&gt; 01:31:36,964
He's dead. That's it.</p>

<p>1047
01:31:37,090 --&gt; 01:31:39,550
What you see there
is all that's left of him.</p>

<p>1048
01:31:48,435 --&gt; 01:31:50,644
And all of the scientists
back then...</p>

<p>1049
01:31:50,770 --&gt; 01:31:52,771
were unable to solve
the mystery...</p>

<p>1050
01:31:52,897 --&gt; 01:31:56,900
so they decided to entrust
all of their collected data and test samples...</p>

<p>1051
01:31:56,943 --&gt; 01:32:00,404
to future generations by preserving them
in frozen capsules and locking them away.</p>

<p>1052
01:32:02,615 --&gt; 01:32:04,116
- SOL. We will use SOL.</p>

<p>1053
01:32:04,117 --&gt; 01:32:04,825
- SOL. We will use SOL.
- Huh?</p>

<p>1054
01:32:07,454 --&gt; 01:32:10,164
Akira has been dead all this time.</p>

<p>1055
01:32:10,582 --&gt; 01:32:13,334
Well, are you satisfied now,
Tetsuo?</p>

<p>1056
01:32:18,465 --&gt; 01:32:20,632
Now will you return with us?</p>

<p>1057
01:32:21,092 --&gt; 01:32:22,468
Like hell!</p>

<p>1058
01:32:23,470 --&gt; 01:32:25,679
Contact the central
defense center...</p>

<p>1059
01:32:25,805 --&gt; 01:32:29,475
and tell them to patch us through
into SOL's main control circuits right away!</p>

<p>1060
01:32:46,993 --&gt; 01:32:48,285
Hey, watch it, you jerk!</p>

<p>1061
01:32:48,411 --&gt; 01:32:52,373
Move! Get out of the way!
Move it!</p>

<p>1062
01:33:08,681 --&gt; 01:33:11,725
What is this,
a science classroom?</p>

<p>1063
01:33:21,861 --&gt; 01:33:22,986
Huh?</p>

<p>1064
01:33:28,701 --&gt; 01:33:31,412
What's wrong?
Have some trouble?</p>

<p>1065
01:33:31,538 --&gt; 01:33:35,374
Yeah, but I already
took care of it.</p>

<p>1066
01:33:35,500 --&gt; 01:33:37,418
And you're too late.
You missed the show.</p>

<p>1067
01:33:37,544 --&gt; 01:33:40,003
Tetsuo,
you had me worried again.</p>

<p>1068
01:33:40,130 --&gt; 01:33:43,215
I figured you'd be standing here,
sobbing like a little baby.</p>

<p>1069
01:33:43,675 --&gt; 01:33:47,928
Kaneda. You've always been
a pain in the ass, you know.</p>

<p>1070
01:33:48,346 --&gt; 01:33:51,098
You've been telling me
what to do since we were kids!</p>

<p>1071
01:33:51,182 --&gt; 01:33:53,100
You always treat me like a kid.</p>

<p>1072
01:33:53,226 --&gt; 01:33:58,230
You always show up and start
bossing me around, and don't you deny it!</p>

<p>1073
01:33:58,356 --&gt; 01:34:02,234
And now you're a boss, too,
of this pile of rumble.</p>

<p>1074
01:34:02,360 --&gt; 01:34:03,735
- Kaneda!</p>

<p>1075
01:34:03,736 --&gt; 01:34:06,113
- Kaneda!
- That's "Mister" Kaneda to you, punk!</p>

<p>1076
01:34:06,239 --&gt; 01:34:08,198
Die!</p>

<p>1077
01:34:18,209 --&gt; 01:34:19,376
Tetsuo!</p>

<p>1078
01:34:42,775 --&gt; 01:34:44,735
Son of a bitch!</p>

<p>1079
01:34:58,458 --&gt; 01:34:59,416
Kei!</p>

<p>1080
01:35:01,461 --&gt; 01:35:02,920
Oh, damn it!</p>

<p>1081
01:35:06,466 --&gt; 01:35:08,509
Let's do it!</p>

<p>1082
01:35:19,771 --&gt; 01:35:21,688
Gotcha!</p>

<p>1083
01:35:22,482 --&gt; 01:35:23,690
What?</p>

<p>1084
01:35:23,983 --&gt; 01:35:24,816
Huh?</p>

<p>1085
01:35:26,986 --&gt; 01:35:29,530
Huh?
The damn battery's dead!</p>

<p>1086
01:35:29,656 --&gt; 01:35:32,115
What's the matter now, Kaneda?</p>

<p>1087
01:35:33,618 --&gt; 01:35:34,785
Damn it!</p>

<p>1088
01:35:34,911 --&gt; 01:35:37,621
It ain't fair, Tetsuo!
Fight with your bare hands!</p>

<p>1089
01:35:41,125 --&gt; 01:35:42,167
Oh, this is funny!</p>

<p>1090
01:35:44,295 --&gt; 01:35:46,505
Feeling frustrated, Kaneda?</p>

<p>1091
01:35:46,631 --&gt; 01:35:49,883
Now do you understand how it feels
being little and helpless?</p>

<p>1092
01:35:52,512 --&gt; 01:35:53,554
Oh?</p>

<p>1093
01:35:56,015 --&gt; 01:35:58,392
Where's this light coming from?</p>

<p>1094
01:36:09,195 --&gt; 01:36:10,112
- Were we on target?</p>

<p>1095
01:36:10,113 --&gt; 01:36:12,030
- Were we on target?
- Hard to tell. Too close to the impact point.</p>

<p>1096
01:36:12,156 --&gt; 01:36:13,031
- The monitors are getting too much electrical...</p>

<p>1097
01:36:13,032 --&gt; 01:36:14,866
- The monitors are getting too much electrical...
- Prepare a second volley, now!</p>

<p>1098
01:36:37,557 --&gt; 01:36:40,058
Hey!</p>

<p>1099
01:36:40,184 --&gt; 01:36:42,102
Kaneda!</p>

<p>1100
01:37:00,204 --&gt; 01:37:03,624
Tetsuo!</p>

<p>1101
01:37:18,514 --&gt; 01:37:19,931
Shit!</p>

<p>1102
01:37:21,267 --&gt; 01:37:23,060
What the......</p>

<p>1103
01:37:27,523 --&gt; 01:37:29,316
Wh...!</p>

<p>1104
01:37:58,888 --&gt; 01:38:00,764
Correcting error now
on tracking system.</p>

<p>1105
01:38:00,890 --&gt; 01:38:02,766
T minus 20...</p>

<p>1106
01:38:02,892 --&gt; 01:38:04,518
Get the fire extinguishers!
Are you okay?</p>

<p>1107
01:38:04,602 --&gt; 01:38:05,435
- Get that fire out!</p>

<p>1108
01:38:05,436 --&gt; 01:38:07,312
- Get that fire out!
- What's going on?</p>

<p>1109
01:38:16,614 --&gt; 01:38:18,115
Kaneda!</p>

<p>1110
01:38:19,659 --&gt; 01:38:21,326
Kai! Kei!</p>

<p>1111
01:38:21,452 --&gt; 01:38:21,827
- Kaneda!</p>

<p>1112
01:38:21,828 --&gt; 01:38:22,536
- Kaneda!
- Kaneda!</p>

<p>1113
01:38:22,829 --&gt; 01:38:23,704
Get on!</p>

<p>1114
01:38:23,788 --&gt; 01:38:24,830
- Where?</p>

<p>1115
01:38:24,831 --&gt; 01:38:26,206
- Where?
- Hurry!</p>

<p>1116
01:38:48,354 --&gt; 01:38:50,355
What is that?</p>

<p>1117
01:39:03,995 --&gt; 01:39:06,079
Reports say it's SOL.</p>

<p>1118
01:39:17,008 --&gt; 01:39:18,925
Magnificent.</p>

<p>1119
01:39:29,061 --&gt; 01:39:31,104
When Tetsuo's power
reaches its peak...</p>

<p>1120
01:39:31,230 --&gt; 01:39:33,106
is that what you're thinking?</p>

<p>1121
01:39:33,232 --&gt; 01:39:37,402
That's when we do it.
But will it really work?</p>

<p>1122
01:39:38,237 --&gt; 01:39:43,283
We know the future doesn't necessarily proceed
along a single course.</p>

<p>1123
01:39:43,409 --&gt; 01:39:46,870
There ought to be a future we can choose.
It's up to us to find it.</p>

<p>1124
01:39:57,089 --&gt; 01:39:58,924
- What's Tetsuo's status, doctor?</p>

<p>1125
01:39:58,925 --&gt; 01:40:00,383
- What's Tetsuo's status, doctor?
- Colonel.</p>

<p>1126
01:40:00,760 --&gt; 01:40:03,637
We set up a camera in the
stadium if you want to check.</p>

<p>1127
01:40:04,013 --&gt; 01:40:06,223
We have him under observation.</p>

<p>1128
01:40:07,517 --&gt; 01:40:11,478
Colonel, you must take a look at this data.
It's phenomenal!</p>

<p>1129
01:40:11,604 --&gt; 01:40:15,315
We're still analyzing the energy
given off by the subject, but it's just magnificent.</p>

<p>1130
01:40:15,441 --&gt; 01:40:17,317
Oh, yes, wonderful.</p>

<p>1131
01:40:17,443 --&gt; 01:40:20,153
Of course, this is clearly
a proton collapse.</p>

<p>1132
01:40:20,279 --&gt; 01:40:24,825
We're also detecting a fair number of what
we believe to be unknown particles to science.</p>

<p>1133
01:40:24,951 --&gt; 01:40:27,285
If we can put this into
a theoretical framework...</p>

<p>1134
01:40:27,411 --&gt; 01:40:29,454
then physics...
quantum physics...</p>

<p>1135
01:40:29,580 --&gt; 01:40:32,499
humanity itself could know
the fundamental truths.</p>

<p>1136
01:40:34,961 --&gt; 01:40:37,254
Uh... Uh... Well, you see...</p>

<p>1137
01:40:37,296 --&gt; 01:40:39,256
we still haven't finished
making our adjustments.</p>

<p>1138
01:40:39,423 --&gt; 01:40:41,091
Wait, Colonel.</p>

<p>1139
01:40:46,556 --&gt; 01:40:48,515
What the... The pattern!</p>

<p>1140
01:40:51,018 --&gt; 01:40:54,187
You bastard!
What did I tell you?</p>

<p>1141
01:40:54,313 --&gt; 01:40:56,189
But, Colonel...</p>

<p>1142
01:40:56,315 --&gt; 01:40:58,692
I couldn't throw away
such a magnificent subject.</p>

<p>1143
01:40:59,986 --&gt; 01:41:00,861
Shut up!</p>

<p>1144
01:41:23,801 --&gt; 01:41:25,844
Oh! Oh, oh! Oh, shit!</p>

<p>1145
01:41:25,845 --&gt; 01:41:27,554
Quick! The battery!</p>

<p>1146
01:41:27,680 --&gt; 01:41:30,724
Come on!
My bike's burning up!</p>

<p>1147
01:41:30,808 --&gt; 01:41:33,310
Hey, what's losing
a bike or two, huh?</p>

<p>1148
01:41:33,436 --&gt; 01:41:36,479
What? Then there's nothing wrong
with using yours, right?</p>

<p>1149
01:41:36,606 --&gt; 01:41:38,356
- I said that out loud, did I?</p>

<p>1150
01:41:38,357 --&gt; 01:41:39,482
- I said that out loud, did I?
- Yeah, you did.</p>

<p>1151
01:41:39,609 --&gt; 01:41:41,526
By the way,
your bike's still on fire.</p>

<p>1152
01:41:41,652 --&gt; 01:41:43,069
Huh? Oh, man! Oh!</p>

<p>1153
01:42:23,527 --&gt; 01:42:25,612
Tetsuo?</p>

<p>1154
01:42:36,540 --&gt; 01:42:40,710
Tetsuo, why is everyone calling you Akira?
What does it mean?</p>

<p>1155
01:42:40,836 --&gt; 01:42:42,754
It means nothing.</p>

<p>1156
01:42:42,880 --&gt; 01:42:44,589
He never existed.</p>

<p>1157
01:42:45,591 --&gt; 01:42:47,467
It doesn't matter who he is.
They don't care.</p>

<p>1158
01:42:50,262 --&gt; 01:42:52,263
Just so long as he destroys things.</p>

<p>1159
01:42:53,432 --&gt; 01:42:55,558
What's that?
Your arm! Look at it!</p>

<p>1160
01:42:55,935 --&gt; 01:42:59,312
Well, it doesn't look like much,
but it still works pretty good.</p>

<p>1161
01:43:02,608 --&gt; 01:43:04,985
What's wrong? Are you okay?</p>

<p>1162
01:43:07,446 --&gt; 01:43:08,613
It's nothing!</p>

<p>1163
01:43:09,365 --&gt; 01:43:10,198
- Tetsuo, I just......</p>

<p>1164
01:43:10,199 --&gt; 01:43:12,575
- Tetsuo, I just......
- Shut up! Just go away!</p>

<p>1165
01:43:19,709 --&gt; 01:43:21,084
Medicine.</p>

<p>1166
01:43:21,752 --&gt; 01:43:25,130
What's wrong, Tetsuo?
Are you in pain? Huh?</p>

<p>1167
01:43:25,256 --&gt; 01:43:28,508
Go back to the lab
and get that medicine.</p>

<p>1168
01:43:28,634 --&gt; 01:43:30,802
Doctor, did you hear that?</p>

<p>1169
01:43:30,928 --&gt; 01:43:32,387
- I did, Colonel.</p>

<p>1170
01:43:32,388 --&gt; 01:43:34,347
- I did, Colonel.
-Well, any signs of it?</p>

<p>1171
01:43:34,807 --&gt; 01:43:36,683
I can't be entirely certain here...</p>

<p>1172
01:43:36,892 --&gt; 01:43:41,521
but it seems that the power which had been
held back by the drugs is breaking free.</p>

<p>1173
01:43:41,647 --&gt; 01:43:45,191
He may not be able to control the power
that has awakened so suddenly!</p>

<p>1174
01:43:45,317 --&gt; 01:43:47,861
He's in an extremely
critical condition!</p>

<p>1175
01:43:48,821 --&gt; 01:43:51,781
Come back to the lab and
receive proper treatment.</p>

<p>1176
01:43:51,824 --&gt; 01:43:53,700
If you don't, you may die.</p>

<p>1177
01:43:55,911 --&gt; 01:44:00,040
You want me to enroll in your kindergarten
and live happily ever after, huh?</p>

<p>1178
01:44:00,166 --&gt; 01:44:02,042
Be quiet
and do what you're told.</p>

<p>1179
01:44:02,168 --&gt; 01:44:05,837
Take your medicine every day
and end up all shriveled like those kids!</p>

<p>1180
01:44:10,843 --&gt; 01:44:14,054
Kaori.</p>

<p>1181
01:44:17,266 --&gt; 01:44:19,017
Fetch medicine, please.</p>

<p>1182
01:44:19,143 --&gt; 01:44:20,310
No.</p>

<p>1183
01:44:20,978 --&gt; 01:44:22,020
Stop, Tetsuo!</p>

<p>1184
01:44:23,981 --&gt; 01:44:25,231
Tetsuo!</p>

<p>1185
01:44:27,026 --&gt; 01:44:28,359
No, Tetsu...!</p>

<p>1186
01:45:00,142 --&gt; 01:45:01,267
Kaneda!</p>

<p>1187
01:45:39,765 --&gt; 01:45:40,640
Huh?</p>

<p>1188
01:45:48,691 --&gt; 01:45:51,067
Son of a... Huh?</p>

<p>1189
01:45:53,946 --&gt; 01:45:56,114
What are you three...doing here?</p>

<p>1190
01:46:02,121 --&gt; 01:46:04,330
You didn't learn
your lesson, did you?</p>

<p>1191
01:46:06,625 --&gt; 01:46:07,959
Heads up, Tetsuo!</p>

<p>1192
01:46:22,141 --&gt; 01:46:23,766
Takashi.</p>

<p>1193
01:46:26,478 --&gt; 01:46:28,271
Akira's here.</p>

<p>1194
01:46:41,452 --&gt; 01:46:45,205
Help, Kaneda! Help, please!</p>

<p>1195
01:46:54,506 --&gt; 01:46:57,175
Kaori!</p>

<p>1196
01:46:59,511 --&gt; 01:47:02,222
Please, help me!</p>

<p>1197
01:47:14,109 --&gt; 01:47:15,985
Help me!</p>

<p>1198
01:47:16,195 --&gt; 01:47:18,029
Let her go!</p>

<p>1199
01:47:35,005 --&gt; 01:47:38,925
Kaori. Kaori. Kaori!</p>

<p>1200
01:47:39,051 --&gt; 01:47:41,678
Tetsuo, are you there?</p>

<p>1201
01:47:41,804 --&gt; 01:47:44,889
Kaori!
Kaori's gonna die!</p>

<p>1202
01:47:45,015 --&gt; 01:47:47,517
What? What did you say?</p>

<p>1203
01:47:47,643 --&gt; 01:47:51,437
My body's not doing
what I tell it to.</p>

<p>1204
01:47:51,563 --&gt; 01:47:55,358
My power's acting
on its own. Kaori!</p>

<p>1205
01:47:55,526 --&gt; 01:47:57,443
Kaori's dying.</p>

<p>1206
01:47:57,653 --&gt; 01:48:00,238
Kaneda, help me!</p>

<p>1207
01:48:00,364 --&gt; 01:48:04,367
Stop this, Tetsuo!
Stop it now!</p>

<p>1208
01:48:04,493 --&gt; 01:48:08,121
Kaori's pain is coming into me.</p>

<p>1209
01:48:09,748 --&gt; 01:48:11,541
Tetsuo!</p>

<p>1210
01:48:12,710 --&gt; 01:48:16,296
Kaneda, run away!</p>

<p>1211
01:48:29,560 --&gt; 01:48:31,436
Tetsuo!</p>

<p>1212
01:48:43,115 --&gt; 01:48:47,076
Kiyoko, Takashi, Masaru!
Hurry! Get away from here!</p>

<p>1213
01:48:51,123 --&gt; 01:48:52,582
Come on!</p>

<p>1214
01:48:58,630 --&gt; 01:49:02,008
I can't believe it. It's as if......</p>

<p>1215
01:49:14,438 --&gt; 01:49:17,357
Kiyoko! Taka......</p>

<p>1216
01:49:51,350 --&gt; 01:49:52,392
Hi.</p>

<p>1217
01:49:54,520 --&gt; 01:49:55,895
Akira.</p>

<p>1218
01:50:04,113 --&gt; 01:50:06,030
Oh, no! That's the......</p>

<p>1219
01:50:07,449 --&gt; 01:50:09,534
But that's impossible!</p>

<p>1220
01:50:19,294 --&gt; 01:50:21,671
Where am I?</p>

<p>1221
01:50:21,797 --&gt; 01:50:25,550
Hurry. Get into the tunnel.
You'll be safe in there.</p>

<p>1222
01:50:25,634 --&gt; 01:50:27,677
Kiyoko, where are you?</p>

<p>1223
01:50:29,346 --&gt; 01:50:30,930
Oh......</p>

<p>1224
01:50:42,234 --&gt; 01:50:43,943
Tetsuo!</p>

<p>1225
01:50:44,069 --&gt; 01:50:46,446
Kaneda!</p>

<p>1226
01:50:46,697 --&gt; 01:50:48,114
Hang on!</p>

<p>1227
01:50:50,325 --&gt; 01:50:51,534
- Hurry! You've got to get out of here!</p>

<p>1228
01:50:51,535 --&gt; 01:50:52,952
- Hurry! You've got to get out of here!
- Out of the way!</p>

<p>1229
01:50:53,078 --&gt; 01:50:54,495
- Tetsuo!</p>

<p>1230
01:50:54,496 --&gt; 01:50:56,080
- Tetsuo!
- Don't go near it!</p>

<p>1231
01:51:02,671 --&gt; 01:51:05,298
No, don't! Wait, Takashi!</p>

<p>1232
01:51:05,424 --&gt; 01:51:08,801
If you went in now, you'd
be trapped along with him.</p>

<p>1233
01:51:08,927 --&gt; 01:51:12,805
But he... None of this
is his fault at all.</p>

<p>1234
01:51:20,105 --&gt; 01:51:21,272
- Takashi!</p>

<p>1235
01:51:21,273 --&gt; 01:51:22,815
- Takashi!
- Takashi!</p>

<p>1236
01:51:29,072 --&gt; 01:51:31,824
If we went in there...</p>

<p>1237
01:51:31,950 --&gt; 01:51:35,244
we wouldn't be strong enough
to come back out again.</p>

<p>1238
01:51:36,455 --&gt; 01:51:38,789
But if the three of us tried...</p>

<p>1239
01:51:38,916 --&gt; 01:51:40,791
maybe we could save that boy.</p>

<p>1240
01:51:40,918 --&gt; 01:51:44,003
You're right.
Us three together.</p>

<p>1241
01:51:53,138 --&gt; 01:51:57,350
Look at that. We should get
out of here now! Hey!</p>

<p>1242
01:51:58,435 --&gt; 01:52:00,353
Kaneda's in there.</p>

<p>1243
01:52:33,136 --&gt; 01:52:36,847
You see that? You're not revving
your engine enough already.</p>

<p>1244
01:52:36,974 --&gt; 01:52:40,560
When you go into a corner,
lean in suicidally. Got it? Now watch.</p>

<p>1245
01:52:40,644 --&gt; 01:52:42,353
- What the hell do you call that?</p>

<p>1246
01:52:42,354 --&gt; 01:52:44,021
- What the hell do you call that?
- Cornering, man.</p>

<p>1247
01:52:45,607 --&gt; 01:52:47,567
You got it, Tetsuo?</p>

<p>1248
01:52:53,907 --&gt; 01:52:56,659
Hey, look! They brought another kid!
Is he a transfer student?</p>

<p>1249
01:52:56,702 --&gt; 01:52:58,035
- His mom and dad left him.</p>

<p>1250
01:52:58,036 --&gt; 01:53:00,496
- His mom and dad left him.
- You can see it in his face.</p>

<p>1251
01:53:03,709 --&gt; 01:53:08,504
Are these... Are these all of your dreams
and memories, Tetsuo?</p>

<p>1252
01:53:10,007 --&gt; 01:53:11,924
Uh, wait.</p>

<p>1253
01:54:29,211 --&gt; 01:54:31,671
Is this Akira?</p>

<p>1254
01:54:31,963 --&gt; 01:54:35,424
Yes. We called
him here to the three of us.</p>

<p>1255
01:54:35,550 --&gt; 01:54:38,010
He's going to take
Tetsuo with him.</p>

<p>1256
01:54:38,095 --&gt; 01:54:41,013
Take him where?
Where?</p>

<p>1257
01:54:41,223 --&gt; 01:54:43,349
It's too much for Tetsuo...</p>

<p>1258
01:54:43,475 --&gt; 01:54:47,186
and for the three of us also
and for Akira too.</p>

<p>1259
01:54:47,312 --&gt; 01:54:50,856
It's way too big
for us, as we are now.</p>

<p>1260
01:54:50,982 --&gt; 01:54:54,694
But someday we ought
to be able to......</p>

<p>1261
01:54:54,820 --&gt; 01:54:58,155
Because it has already begun.</p>

<p>1262
01:54:58,281 --&gt; 01:55:00,700
Your friend, she's......</p>

<p>1263
01:55:00,826 --&gt; 01:55:02,368
My friend?</p>

<p>1264
01:55:03,286 --&gt; 01:55:06,205
Kei! It's Kei
you're talking about!</p>

<p>1265
01:55:31,857 --&gt; 01:55:33,733
Tetsuo.</p>

<p>1266
01:55:38,113 --&gt; 01:55:40,030
This is yours, right?</p>

<p>1267
01:55:45,871 --&gt; 01:55:48,748
They're always like that
with the new kids.</p>

<p>1268
01:55:48,874 --&gt; 01:55:50,249
Hey, you came today, right?</p>

<p>1269
01:55:50,375 --&gt; 01:55:54,754
They beat me up too, but the truth is,
those guys are wimps.</p>

<p>1270
01:55:54,880 --&gt; 01:55:58,090
My name is... Tetsuo.</p>

<p>1271
01:55:58,216 --&gt; 01:55:59,592
Tetsuo Shima.</p>

<p>1272
01:56:01,344 --&gt; 01:56:04,346
The truth is,
I just got here myself.</p>

<p>1273
01:56:04,473 --&gt; 01:56:06,182
My name is......</p>

<p>1274
01:56:06,558 --&gt; 01:56:10,770
Kaneda. Kaneda.</p>

<p>1275
01:56:11,229 --&gt; 01:56:12,229
- Kaneda!</p>

<p>1276
01:56:12,230 --&gt; 01:56:12,938
- Kaneda!
- Kei.</p>

<p>1277
01:56:39,591 --&gt; 01:56:42,134
What in the world is happening?
What's this?</p>

<p>1278
01:56:45,514 --&gt; 01:56:47,640
No, this isn't......</p>

<p>1279
01:56:47,766 --&gt; 01:56:51,811
If this is correct, it's showing that this is
the birth of the universe.</p>

<p>1280
01:56:58,443 --&gt; 01:57:01,570
Kei!</p>

<p>1281
01:57:06,952 --&gt; 01:57:08,994
What's going on here?</p>

<p>1282
01:57:11,122 --&gt; 01:57:12,957
Disappearing.
It's disappearing.</p>

<p>1283
01:58:24,279 --&gt; 01:58:26,530
Kaneda, can you hear me?</p>

<p>1284
01:58:49,888 --&gt; 01:58:51,263
Tetsuo.</p>

<p>1285
01:58:54,351 --&gt; 01:58:56,602
Kaneda, what is it?</p>

<p>1286
01:58:57,228 --&gt; 01:58:58,354
Thank you.</p>

<p>1287
01:58:58,813 --&gt; 01:58:59,772
Huh?</p>

<p>1288
01:59:00,190 --&gt; 01:59:03,108
You called me, didn't you,
and I heard you.</p>

<p>1289
01:59:10,408 --&gt; 01:59:12,785
Kaneda! Oh, my!</p>

<p>1290
01:59:13,495 --&gt; 01:59:15,037
Where's Tetsuo?</p>

<p>1291
01:59:16,247 --&gt; 01:59:17,706
He just left.</p>

<p>1292
01:59:18,750 --&gt; 01:59:21,794
Those kids did too.
Akira also.</p>

<p>1293
01:59:22,253 --&gt; 01:59:24,922
Kaneda, back then...
Oh, did you just...</p>

<p>1294
01:59:26,508 --&gt; 01:59:28,384
Kaneda!</p>

<p>1295
01:59:28,510 --&gt; 01:59:31,053
You're alive!</p>

<p>1296
01:59:31,179 --&gt; 01:59:33,305
I thought...</p>

<p>1297
01:59:33,556 --&gt; 01:59:35,933
I thought you were
in there for sure.</p>

<p>1298
01:59:38,770 --&gt; 01:59:41,105
Tetsuo!
What happened to Tetsuo?</p>

<p>1299
01:59:41,773 --&gt; 01:59:43,107
Is he dead?</p>

<p>1300
01:59:43,233 --&gt; 01:59:44,817
I'm not sure.</p>

<p>1301
01:59:45,402 --&gt; 01:59:47,403
Something... Oh!</p>

<p>1302
02:00:12,637 --&gt; 02:00:16,181
But someday we
ought to be able to......</p>

<p>1303
02:00:16,307 --&gt; 02:00:19,685
Because it has already begun.</p>
